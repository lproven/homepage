<h1><font size=5>NEC MultiSync XE17</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Large but attractive, with good controls, but disappointing 
performance and specification for the price. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;999</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Nippon Electric Corporation invented the multisync monitor, and have 
registered the word itself as their trademark, so we expected something a 
little special, and we got it: the only 17in monitor in this Labs with a 
maximum rated resolution of 1024x768, the minimum most people would 
expect of a 17in screen. Windows 95 correctly detected and identified the 
monitor on startup, and the we couldn't select any higher resolution. 
Overriding the Windows monitor with Matrox's monitor selection utility 
allowed higher resolution modes of 1152x864 and 1280x1024, but both 
were at a rather flickery 60Hz. Within its rated range, it's a lot better, and at 
1024x768 the image is clear and stable, but fine detail is poor, perhaps 
because of the comparitively coarse 0.28mm dot pitch.</p>
<p>The XE17 is an imposing beast, with a huge, flat frame around the CRT 
itself. The controls aren't recessed, but are presented as neat little buttons 
below the screen, with eight separate buttons to make controlling the 
excellent and helpful on-screen menus easy. There are also separate wheels 
for controlling brightness and contrast, though these don't have the usual 
&quot;sticking point&quot; to indicate the centre of the range, and the brightness 
control's range is small.</p>
<p>Swinging the unit around on its stiff stand, the back is unusually attractive: 
curved, and devoid of ventilation slots or large stickers, it looks as good 
from either side - ideal for a reception desk or anywhere where it's rear is 
on view. The cables aren't recessed very far, but the curvature means it will 
still fit up against a wall if necessary. Snags for some people will be the 
absence of BNC connectors, and a non-switching power supply. All things 
considered, this is a disappointing screen for such a big name and big price.</p>
