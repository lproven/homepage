<h1><font size=4>How a PC Works: Motherboards</font></h1>
<hr>
<h2><font size=3>Introduction</font></h2>
<p>The motherboard is the fabric that interconnects all the other components of 
a PC. It's composed of a chipset, known as the &quot;glue logic&quot;, some code in 
ROM, and the various interconnections or buses. Modern PC designs use 
multiple different buses to link their various components. Wide, high-speed 
buses are difficult and expensive to produce: the signals travel so fast that 
distances of only a few centimetres cause timing problems, and the metal 
tracks on the circuit board act as miniature radio antenn&aelig;, transmitting 
electromagnetic noise that cause interference with signals elsewhere in the 
system. For these reasons, the engineers designing PC systems try to keep 
the fastest buses confined to the smallest area of the motherboard they can, 
and use slower, more robust buses for other parts.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Bus logic</font></h2>
<p>The fastest bus of all is the connection between the processor and its 
primary cache, and this is kept within the CPU chip. The next level down is 
the host bus, which links the processor with the memory, both the small 
amount of static RAM cache and the far larger main banks of DRAM. This 
is 64 bits wide and runs at around 50-75MHz, depending on the speed of 
the CPU. The CPU doesn't communicate directly with the memory, but 
through the intermediary of the System Controller chip, which manages the 
host bus and bridges between it and the PCI bus.</p>
<h2><font size=3>PCI versus ISA </font></h2>
<p>The main performance-critical components of the PC communicate with 
each other across the PCI bus, which is half the width and half the speed of 
the host bus. The most common PCI devices are typically the disk and 
graphics controllers, which are either mounted directly onto the 
motherboard or on expansion cards in PCI slots. Most modern PCI 
chipsets include a built-in EIDE interface, but not graphics or SCSI 
controllers. Network adaptors are another common extra, but the high 
speed of PCI isn't really necessary for ordinary 10Mbit/s Ethernet. Also on 
the PCI bus is another bridge, this time linking the PCI bus to the ISA bus.</p>
<p>Originally introduced in the IBM PC-AT in 1984, the AT bus is by modern 
standards a very slow one. Only 16 bits wide, it was originally rated for a 
maximum speed of only 8MHz, although many modern ISA devices can run 
faster than this. It's now used only for non-performance critical devices, 
such as the serial and parallel ports, mouse and keyboard connectors, and 
options such as sound cards.</p>
<h2><font size=3>On the buses</font></h2>
<p>The design of the original PC included virtually nothing on the motherboard 
itself aside from CPU, memory, and interfaces for the keyboard and a tape 
cassette unit - floppy disks were an expensive optional extra. Whilst the 
tape unit has thankfully long gone, the keyboard socket remains, but from 
the PC's point of view, everything else is located on one of the expansion 
buses - even though many &quot;peripherals&quot; are now part of the chipset.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Glue and chips</font></h2>
<p>Tying all this together is not a trivial task. There are three different buses, of 
different widths, running at different speeds. Although different 
manufacturer's designs vary, the best-known at present is Intel's &quot;Triton 2&quot; 
or 82430HX PCIset. The HX chipset comprises just two chips, the 
82439HX System Controller or SC (which manages the host and PCI 
buses) and the 82371SB PIIX3, which manages the ISA bus and all the 
ports - also used in the Triton VX chipset. </p>
<p>The SC has the greatest effect on the machine's CPU performance, as it 
manages communications between CPU and memory. The CPU has to be 
fed with data from the secondary cache as quickly as possible, and if the 
necessary data isn't already in the cache, the SC fetches it from main 
memory and loads it into the cache. The SC also takes care of ensuring that 
data written into cache by the CPU is &quot;flushed&quot; back into main memory - in 
the HX chipset, this can include data flowing through two Pentium CPUs.</p>
<p>The PIIX3 chip manages the many processes involved in getting data into 
and out of RAM from the other devices in the PC. It provides two EIDE 
channels, both of which can accept two drives. IDE drives contain most of 
the controlling circuitry built into the hard disk itself (thus the name, 
&quot;Integrated Drive Electronics&quot;), so the PIIX' job mainly involves shifting data 
from the drives into RAM and back as fast as possible. It also provides two 
115,200K buffered serial ports, an error-correcting Enhanced Parallel Port, 
a PS/2 mouse port, and a keyboard controller.</p>
<p>The PIIX also supports additional connections that aren't yet included in 
many motherboards, such as a Universal Serial Bus connector and an 
infra-red port.&#160;</p>
<h2><font size=3>USB</font></h2>
<p>The Universal Serial Bus is a new standardised connector for attaching all 
the common I/O devices to a single port, simplifying today's multiplicity of 
different ports and connectors. If it takes off, future PCs might just have a 
USB port instead of the current 4 or 5 different ones. Onto this would be 
connected some large, powered device - like a monitor or printer - which 
would act as a hub, linking up all the smaller devices such as mouse, 
keyboard, joystick, modem etc. A similar but simpler system, the Apple 
Desktop Bus, has been a standard feature of the Macintosh for many years, 
so the concept is proven - but it requires support from the industry which 
isn't happening yet.</p>
<h2><font size=3>ROM and CMOS RAM</font></h2>
<p>There are two small blocks of memory included on all motherboards, which 
are separate from the main system memory used for loading and running 
software.</p>
<h2><font size=3>ROM</font></h2>
<p>The ROM contains the PC's Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). This 
comprises several separate routines, serving different functions. The first part 
runs as soon as the machine is powered-on. It inspects the computer to 
determine what hardware is fitted, then conducts some simple tests to check 
everything is functioning normally - a process called the Power-On Self Test 
(POST). If any of the peripherals are Plug 'n' Play devices, at this point the 
BIOS assigns their resources.</p>
<p>At this point, there's an option to enter the Setup program. This allows the 
user to tell the PC what hardware is fitted, but with automatic 
self-configuring BIOSes, this is becoming less used.</p>
<p>If all the tests are passed, the ROM tries to boot the machine from the first 
hard disk. Failing that, it will try the CD-ROM drive, then the floppy drive, 
and then give up and display a message that it needs a system disk.</p>
<p>Once the machine has booted, the BIOS serves a different function: it 
presents to DOS a standardised API for the PC hardware. In the days 
before Windows, this was a vital function, but 32-bit &quot;protect mode&quot; 
software doesn't use the BIOS, so it's of less today.</p>
<h2><font size=3>CMOS RAM</font></h2>
<p>All PCs have a small amount of memory made from very 
lower-power-consumption CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon) 
RAM chips, which is kept &quot;alive&quot; by a battery even when the PC's power is 
off. This is used to store the basic information about the PC's configuration - 
number and type of hard and floppy disk drives, how much memory and 
what kind, etc. All this used to be entered manually, but modern 
auto-configuring BIOSes do much of it for you, and in such machines, the 
more important settings are advanced options such as DRAM timings.</p>
<p>The other important data kept in CMOS memory is the time and date, 
which is updated by a Real-time Clock (RTC.) The clock, CMOS RAM 
and battery are commonly all integrated into a single chip. The PC reads the 
time from the RTC when it boots up, after which the CPU keeps time - a 
common cause of system clocks keeping bad time. Regularly rebooting the 
PC causes the RTC to be re-read and can help them to be more accurate. </p>
