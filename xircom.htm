<p>Notebook computers have become an essential work tool for many
people, but they haven't entirely broken the bonds that tie down
their desktop cousins. Pointing devices, colour screens and
expansion slots are now standard, Advanced Power Management helps
to make the most of batteries that still only give full power for
a few hours, and Infra-red (IrDA) ports allow connection to other
PCs, printers and pocket computers, merely by placing them within
a few meters of each other. This gives the ease of transfer of a
LapLink cable without any physical connection - but with the same
limitations: it's a fixed one-to-one link, unlike a network,
where any machine can talk to any other.</p>
<p>Several companies have produced wireless network systems
before now, but they face several problems. For radio-based
systems, the government-allotted frequencies are different all
around the world; also, most companies don&#146;t care for the
idea of PCs literally broadcasting company data over the
airwaves. Non-radio based technologies such as infra-red and
microwave usually only work over a short range with a direct
line-of-sight between receiver and transmitter, which means you
need lots of access points mounted on the ceiling or high on the
walls - an undesirable and expensive option for most companies.</p>
<p>Xircom&#146;s alternative uses a technology called <i>spread-spectrum
radio</i> (SSR). Normally radio systems, such as
&quot;walkie-talkies&quot;, use a single, fixed radio frequency
for communicating between transmitter and receiver. SSR only uses
one frequency at a time, but that frequency changes many times a
second; both ends of the link &quot;know&quot; the sequence of
different frequencies that will be used, and jump from one to the
next in synchrony. This system has several advantages: firstly,
it&#146;s very hard to eavesdrop, because even if you know the
jump sequence you have to be in synch with the others, and
secondly, it&#146;s almost immune to interference, because this
usually only affects a small range of frequencies at any time,
and the SSR system never stays in one region of the spectrum for
more than an instant. Netwave uses the unregulated 2.4Gigahertz
band, the same as microwave ovens and some other appliances, but
uses less than 10% of the power of, for instance, a cellphone.</p>
<p>As Xircom is a specialist in PCMCIA devices, the Netwave
cordless network revolves around PC Cards: either a pair of
notebooks with one each, or multiple Netwave-equipped notebooks
talking to a Netwave Access Point, (AP) a small box which
attaches to an Ethernet network and has a slot for a Netwave
card, thereby allowing any Netwave-equipped PCs to access the
resources on the Ethernet network. Unfortunately, there&#146;s no
Token Ring version, although Dayna sell a Macintosh version of
the system called DaynaCOMM Roamer. A Netwave card can
communicate with any other over a distance of up to about 50m
inside a building (250m outside), so for bigger offices,
it&#146;s possible to set up multiple APs on a single Ethernet
network segment, allowing a notebook user to roam around the
building while the Netwave card in the notebook automatically
locates and uses the nearest AP.</p>
<p>Xircom provides a range of device drivers for the card - I
tried their drivers for Novell Netware, Windows for Workgroups
and Windows 95. Xircom&#146;s driver disks are odd; on the first
disk is a Setup program, but this doesn&#146;t install the
drivers onto your PC as you might expect. Instead, it merely
unpacks the drivers and writes them to disk - dangerously,
straight onto the original Xircom disks, which don&#146;t come
write-protected. After this, you must use your network
software&#146;s own setup program to configure your network
software for the Netwave card. I couldn&#146;t get this procedure
to work reliably, so on the recommendation of Xircom&#146;s
helpful technical support line, I downloaded newer drivers from
Compuserve, which contained pre-unpacked drivers that installed
without difficulty. Xircom claims that this is unusual, but
I&#146;ve used their cards before and encountered the same
strangely-useless setup program.</p>
<p>I tried the card in three notebook PCs, an Aries Perfecta, a
CTX EasyBook and a Dell Latitude LX. All three of these machines
were first tried with a Farallon EtherWave card (a re-badged 3Com
Etherlink III PCMCIA) which worked fine in all. Unfortunately,
the first two machines, which were running DOS and Windows 3.x,
both had serious problems. On the CTX, the card initialised but
would not connect to the network. On the Watford machine, it made
a connection using the Novell software, but was unable to logon,
while Windows for Workgroups didn&#146;t even get that far;
Windows 95, by contrast, worked fine, as it did on the Dell,
which came pre-installed with Windows 95. This kind of
incompatibility problem isn&#146;t too unusual with PC Cards,
where there is far too much variation between different
manufacturers&#146; interpretations of the PCMCIA standard;
usually a card can be persuaded to work, with some tweaking.
Xircom recognise that Netwave is more complex than an normal
wired network, and have established a community of Netwave
Service Providers, trained resellers who will survey your site,
as well as setting up and integrating a Netwave system with an
existing LAN.</p>
<p>Physically, the cards have no external cables or connectors,
just a flat rectangular postage-stamp sized radio aerial sticking
out of one end - a problem on some machines whose designers have
put covers over the PC Card slots. As I only had one card and one
AP, I couldn&#146;t try the roaming AP feature, but as I wandered
around Dennis Publishing&#146;s offices, the card maintained a
connection as long as it wasn&#146;t completely cut off from the
AP by too many walls and doors, even from five stories up;
outside, a peer-to-peer link worked over a distance of about a
quarter of a kilometre, and a machine with both cards in could
&quot;see&quot; the rest of the Ethernet network alongside the
other Netwave machine. I could even &quot;hot swap&quot; the
Xircom and 3Com cards without losing the network connection The
connection runs at 1 Mbit/sec - about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
[i. e. one tenth] the speed of Ethernet; slow, but perfectly
usable, although the connection does tend to get slower as you
reach the limit of the cards&#146; range. </p>
