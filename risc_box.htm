<h1><font size=5>Upsetting the Wintel Applecart</font></h1>
<hr>
<h2><font size=4>RISC based processors are gaining momentum in the 
Intel-dominated marketplace.</font></h2>
<p>Most of the world's computers are Intel-based PCs running Microsoft's 
DOS and Windows. This has happened because each new Intel chip is 
designed to be compatible with all the previous ones' software - thus 
inheriting some of the problems of the first models' early-80s design. The 
80x86 family of processors are based on the CISC (Complex Instruction 
Set Computer) principle - their power lies in the rich and varied range of 
functions built into the processor. The main alternative way to design 
processors is known as RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), which 
essentially means that the processor is stripped for speed - a wide range of 
commands is sacrificed for a small set of the most-often-used ones, which 
are optimised for speed. RISC chips are generally faster than CISC ones, 
and because they're smaller, they're cheaper, too. These advantages have 
lead several companies to create their own lines of RISC processors: the 
Alpha AXP from Digital, Silicon Graphics' MIPS Rx000 series, and IBM 
and Motorola's PowerPC, used in Apple's later Macintosh computers.</p>
<p>The RISC vendors' problem is competing with the deeply-established Intel 
monopoly: Intel and Microsoft have such a stranglehold over the PC 
marketplace that the two companies have become synonymous, leading 
Scott McNealy of Sun to coin the term 'Wintel' when referring to them. 
Currently, only Apple and the tiny British Acorn sell general-purpose PCs 
based on RISC chips - most of the other RISC manufacturers stick to 
expensive UNIX workstations and minicomputer servers. This is part of the 
rationale behind NT - the first and only non-processor-dependant version of 
Windows - it lessens Microsoft's dependency on Intel, and gives them a 
chance to enter the high-end RISC market. The current version of Windows 
NT, 3.5, runs on only two non-Intel processors: the MIPS R4x00 and the 
Digital Alpha. However, these aren't widely used except by their respective 
manufacturers - but this is about to change.</p>
<p>The biggest computer company in the world, IBM, the second-biggest 
processor manufacturer, Motorola, and the biggest non-Intel PC 
manufacturer, Apple, have formed a cartel to design their own RISC chip - 
the PowerPC. Most of Apple's Macintosh computers are now based 
around PowerPC processors, and they are selling well, showing that 
PowerPC personal computers can compete with Intel Pentiums on both 
price and performance. This might not sound like a big deal when Alpha, 
MIPS and PowerPC sales put together don't add up to more than a fraction 
of all the Intel processors sold each year, but it has immense potential.</p>
<p>Apple's latest Power Macintosh, the 9500, is their first PCI-bus machine - 
bringing it closer to the PC mainstream than ever before. The next major 
release of Apple's MacOS operating system will for the first time run on any 
PowerPC computer, without any Apple chips - opening up the possibility of 
Macintoshes running Windows, and MacOS running on non-Apple PCs. 
Motorola and IBM already make PowerPC-based computers - if a few 
other big names jump onto the Apple's bandwagon, it could start to 
shoulder Intel off the road.</p>
