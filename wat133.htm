<h1><font size=5>Watford Aries Professional Media PC</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Watford Electronics 01582-487777 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,338 (all in); &#163;1,130 (no sound system); &#163;1,032 (no sound / 
modem)</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A lavish bundle with an impressive warranty, but it's neither 
very fast or very cheap.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Watford has interpreted our system specification slightly differently from 
most of the other suppliers, including a 16-bit soundcard with powered 
speakers and an external modem in the bundle. This pushes the price up 
slightly, and as we didn't ask for them, they have not been reviewed.</p>
<p>Whilst it's not normally where we'd start a system review, the first thing that 
struck us about this system when we unpacked it was its keyboard, and 
then its mouse. The keyboard is an interesting device: it comes with a 
detachable wrist-rest that hooks onto the front. The feel isn't great, but it's 
very comfortable to use. Another oddity is the extra button at the top right 
of the keyboard, just like the power key on an Apple Macintosh. This is a 
reset button - not a hard reset, it merely simulates Ctrl-Alt-Del. In Windows 
95, this pops-up the Close Program dialog box, while in DOS it restarts the 
PC. This is neat, and no more superfluous than the &quot;Windows 95 keys&quot; - 
which it also has. The mouse is a pleasant change, too; it's the same 
left-handed model as Hi-Grade's.</p>
<p>The rest of the PC is less idiosyncratic. The case is a modest minitower, 
only enlivened by a bright red reset button. Although it's quite well-equipped 
with drive bays, one minor failing is that a front-panel 3.5in drive bay is 
occupied by the Seagate ST51270A 1.2Gb hard disk, while there's a free 
bay under the power supply - so if you wanted to fit a removable 3.5in 
drive, you'd have to move the HD yourself. Otherwise, the interior is neat 
and tidy, with the neat touch of expansion slot blanking plates that just clip 
into place without screws - fine, until you fit a card, when you have to find a 
retaining screw from somewhere. Graphics are provided by a basic but 
serviceable GrafixStar 300 driving a modest Mitac 15in monitor.</p>
<p>Windows 95 has been slightly customised, with support details in the 
System control panel and a photograph of Watford's HQ as wallpaper, but 
this didn't extend to the Win95 service pack or bus-mastering drivers. All 
the software for the soundcard and modem were correctly in place, though, 
which is good to see. There's also a bundle of 10 CD titles, which wasn't 
supplied, whilst a copy of MS Office 95 will cost &#163;149 extra.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a good package, especially when the excellent 6 year 
warranty is taken into account. Watford's already been around for 20 years, 
so it should survive to honour this, too. However, the performance isn't 
stunning, and the price is quite high.</p>
