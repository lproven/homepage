<h1><font size=5>IBM PC350-P133</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>The 133MHz Pentium variant of the PC350 line is very new for IBM, and 
we only got a brief look at an early and incomplete unit. Along with 
Compaq, their biggest competitor, IBM was behind the times in shipping the 
machine with Windows 3.1 installed, but there is a good reason for this - the 
PC also has OS/2 Warp on the hard disk, and Warp needs to have 
Windows 3 installed to be able to run Windows programs; it can't use 
Windows 95 for the purpose. To run the benchmarks, we attached it to our 
network and upgraded it to Windows 95 - revealing this to be the first 
machine we've seen that hung -repeatedly - during Windows 95's hardware 
detection process; we had to remove our NE2000-compatible network 
card to get it to complete. Still, all the machine's hardware was correctly 
identified and configured - although as our review machine lacked sound or 
CD facilities, this was easier than on some.</p>
<p>The PC350's case is roomy and capacious, with a cover that's easily 
removed using just a catch at the back. The front is attractive, with a sliding 
panel that can cover the drive bays and be locked in place - excellent for 
security-conscious companies - and it's equally suited to being stood up as a 
mini-tower. All the connectors are around the back, and include twin PS/2 
ports (for the pleasant IBM mouse and unremarkable keyboard) which 
ought to be at the front of the case, where the power switch is. Inside, it's 
clean and accessible; two PCI connectors share slots with ISA ones, and 
one ISA slot is on the reverse side of the riser card and is therefore 
somewhat inaccessible. One ISA slot would usually be occupied by an IBM 
Jazz 16 sound card, along with an IBM quad-speed ATAPI CD-ROM, but 
IBM doesn't normally supply speakers. A slightly fuzzy IBM 15&quot; monitor 
was supplied - if IBM ship a monitor-adjustment utility with customers' 
machines, this should be correctable, but it's annoying that there's no 
pass-through power connector for it, as there was on the original IBM PC 
and AT machines.</p>
<p>The motherboard, or &quot;planar&quot; in IBM's idiosyncratic terminology, is 
designed and built by IBM around Intel's Triton chipset, and includes an S3 
Trio64 graphics controller - reasonable, but not distinguished. As IBM has 
its own networking system, Token Ring, it's less surprising than the machine 
lacks integrated Ethernet. </p>
<p>Overall, it's neat, but nowhere near as impressive as IBM's older PS/2 
range. IBM invented the PC and remains, along with Compaq, one of the 
two biggest manufacturers, so you might expect an IBM PC to be an 
especially fine one. Some industry analysts predict that the current 
consolidation in the PC industry will leave only the biggest five or six 
vendors in business by the turn of the century, and it's sad to see that IBM's 
latest PC, though respectable, lacks the flair of some of other big names' 
machines, such as Compaq and Digital, with their beautifully-designed PCs, 
which include integrated sound and networking.</p>
