<h1><font size=5>Nokia Communicator 9000</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict:	If comms are your priority, this is the best there is, far 
better than a separate phone and PDA; but the price is high. </font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Communicator is by far the neatest and sexiest unit on test: a real 
mobile comms-enabled PDA, it includes most of the standard PDA 
functions - notepad, diary, addressbook, calculator etc - alongside a 
comprehensive set of voice and data communications tools. It can be used 
as a standard cellular phone, similar in specification to the Nokia 2110 as 
used in the HP OmniGo 700LX. It also can send and receive faxes, Internet 
email, Short Messaging Service messages, browse the Web, and act as a 
text terminal.</p>
<p>Physically, it's a fat cellphone, but no bigger than ordinary cellphones of a 
few years ago, although unlike an ordinary cellphone, the microphone and 
speaker are on the &quot;back&quot; - the opposite side to the keys and LCD. 
However, the &quot;clamshell&quot; case opens like a notebook PC to reveal a 
greyscale LCD screen in the lid, and a QWERTY keyboard resembling the 
Sharp's in the base. The system is based around a 386 with 2Mb RAM; it 
runs similar GEOS software to the OmniGo 100, but the hardware's more 
powerful. The display looks better because of the bigger, greyscale screen; 
it's about three times the width of the OmniGo's tiny, square display. It's not 
much faster in use though, and sometimes hesitant when switching apps.</p>
<p>Its user interface is very simple and clean. There's a line of nine application 
keys at the top of the keyboard; pressing one takes you straight into that 
program. There's no &quot;main screen&quot; as such, and the programs multitask with 
one another. The main communications applications are 'Tel', 'Fax', 'SMS' 
and 'Internet'. The Tel program is a different user interface to the telephone, 
allowing you to dial any entry in the contact list directly. Fax allows 
transmission to and from any ordinary fax machine. Messages can be written 
on the Communicator's word-processor using a variety of fonts and styles, 
and a neat, professional coverpage is automatically generated. Digital 
cellphones use three separate numbers for voice, data and fax calls, which 
have different rings. When a call comes in on the fax number, the 
Communicator automatically receives and stores it, which is far neater than 
the HP 700LX's method. Short Messages can be composed and sent to 
any other SMS-capable cellphone in their own application, which is far 
easier than using an unaided phone keypad; numbers can be selected from 
the contact list. Recieved messages are filed away automatically, again 
unlike the HP system. </p>
<p>The most complex package is the Internet suite. This includes an 
SMTP/POP3 Mail program, a basic Mosaic-like Web browser, and a 
basic terminal emulator that can connect via Telnet or cellular modem. The 
snag of the Communicator's GEOS software is that you can't install PC mail 
clients, but most mainstream mail servers can handle text-terminal or HTML 
connections these days, so this isn't critical. </p>
<p>More conventional PDA tools include 'Contacts', 'Notes', 'Calendar', 
'System' and 'Extras'. Contacts and Calendar are basic versions of the main 
PIM tools: a diary and addressbook. Notes is more complex, including the 
WP package and a document manager that integrates all the text-based 
programs, including SMS, mail messages, outgoing faxes, etc., as well as 
user-created files.</p>
<p>System and Extras round out the GEOS suite; the former includes tools for 
configuration, file transfer and import/export, backup/restore, software 
installation and so on, while the latter, like the Newton, is the repository for 
other applications. The standard items are a calculator, clock, and 
&quot;Composer&quot;, a full stave-based editor to modify the rings and other sounds 
used by the phone.</p>
<p><font size=4>Personal Opinion </font></p>
<p>The Communicator 9000 is one of the most impressive high-tech toys I've 
seen in recent years. It's tiny and remarkably highly-integrated, and would 
be a genuinely useful device for any mobile worker. What it lacks are some 
of the common facilities of other, more conventional PDAs: there's no card 
slot, so you can't expand its storage or add extra facilities. There's no kind 
of pointing device, so you can't write or draw on its screen. The GEOS 
system is still relatively new and rare, so there's little third-party software - 
rich resources for Psion, Apple and HP owners. It's own facilities are 
inevitably limited, so rich, easy communications with desktop machines are 
essential, but it's software is rudimentary. A Windows packge is supplied, 
which is good to see, but this is just a server to allow the Communicator to 
access the PC's drives; all backup and file transfer/conversion functions are 
performed by the Communicator itself. Whilst this simplicity makes 
development of servers for different machines very straightforward, the 
success of the Pilot has shown that a simple, one-press package to 
synchronise PDA and PC is a huge advantage. The older Newton 1.0 
machines and the Psion have good PC and Mac connectivity, although a 
step behind the Pilot's; HP and Nokia really need to catch up.</p>
<p>The Communicator doesn't have any I/O ports as such; there's an infra-red 
port, but we couldn't get this to talk to an Adaptec AirPort 2000 desktop 
IR interface, even though this was perfectly happy with the HP devices. It 
has a proprietary connector at the base which takes a tiny &quot;docking station&quot; 
less than 2&quot; long, providing a connector for the battery charger and an 
RS232 port with a nonstandard connector. Unfortunately, we didn't have 
the connecting cable, so we couldn't try this out, and we were unable to test 
the contact database as we couldn't get it onto the machine.</p>
