<h1><font size=5>Trust Imagery 4800SP</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Another variant of the Mustek 600. Better software than 
Primax, but only worth it if discounted to a similar price. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: 01376-501146 </font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Trust is the brand name of Aashima, one of the biggest European computer 
distributors - many systems from smaller vendors are built around Trust 
parts. In this instance, the Imagery 4800SP is actually an OEM version of 
the Mustek MFC-600 in a slightly different case. As such, many of the 
comments in the reviews of the Primax Compact 4800 and Mustek 600 
scanners also apply to this, especially the non-standard SCSI connections, 
the TWAIN drivers and the proprietary card. Unsuprisingly, the 
performance under test was very similar, too.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that the names of the two OEM versions of this 
scanner imply that it&#146;s capable of 4,800ppi, albeit through interpolation from 
300x600. It&#146;s odd, therefore, that the TWAIN control program&#146;s resolution 
slider only goes up to a maximum of 1,200ppi. We tried the Text 
Readability benchmark at both the native 300ppi resolution and the 
interpolated 1,200ppi, but the results were very little different. The 
characters were very slightly better defined at the higher resolution, but the 
image was spoiled by artefacts caused by the interpolation process, with 
vertical lines acquiring blurred fringes.</p>
<p>The Trust version of the scanner has a better software bundle; it comes 
supplied with WordLinx OCR and the tackily-named ImagePals 2 GO! 
image-editing package (by ULead, the same company as the Primax&#146; 
FinishingTOUCH). ImagePals is a 16-bit mini-suite, comprising editor, file 
manager and viewer programs. The editor is a slightly uprated version of 
FinishingTOUCH, but we&#146;d still prefer PaintShop Pro. The manager is more 
impressive, handling sound and video files as well as pictures, and the 
viewer is neat.</p>
<p>The OCR element is WordLinx, a new name to us. It&#146;s good to see both 
16- and 32-bit versions supplied, although the 32-bit one is a newer 
version. Installation only ran from DOS mode and swapped between disks 
1 and 2 four times, which is excessive. We also had to manually select the 
scanner. After all this palaver, it was quite neat. The program sits, iconised, 
at the bottom of the screen. Double-clicking it and choosing Scan presents 
the standard TWAIN dialogue, and it&#146;s up to the user to pick the right 
settings. As the Primax TWAIN driver doesn&#146;t have an OCR setting, we 
chose LineArt, which seemed to work well; WordLink scanned the &#147;Real 
World Computing&#148; page, auto-zoned and recognised it, then launched 
WordPad with the text loaded in. Accuracy was quite good, approaching 
OmniPage Pro&#146;s, but all formatting was lost.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, this version of this scanner is some &#163;80 more expensive 
than Primax&#146; equivalent, which is a lot to pay for just some better bundled 
software - but street prices will vary.</p>
