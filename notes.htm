<p><strong>This page contains links to sundry different pieces of published 
writing, mostly reviews. They fall into two categories - computing and 
science fiction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are interested in republishing any of these articles, either 
online or in the press, please </strong><a href="mailto:lproven@cix.co.uk"><strong>contact</strong></a><strong> me. I am happy for material to 
be used, but </strong><em><strong>by permission only. </strong></em><strong>All material on this site is copyright 
&#169; Liam Proven, and first publication was by Dennis Publishing 
except where otherwise stated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also usually have a small number of finished or part-complete 
features or articles that I have written for my own use. [Currently 
this includes features on RISC computing, object-oriented 
programming and operating systems and getting online for PC 
novices. If you are interested in using these for publication or 
training purposes, </strong><a href="mailto:lproven@cix.co.uk"><strong>contact</strong></a><strong> me.]</strong></p>
