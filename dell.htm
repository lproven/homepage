<h1><font size="5">Dell Dimension XPS P166s MT</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3">Supplier: 01344-720000</font></h3>
<h3><font size="3">Price: &#163;1,399</font></h3>

<h3><font size="3">Verdict: Good specifications and build
quality, marred by economy measures and poor customisation.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p><font size="3">Dell has a good name as a builder of fast,
high-quality systems, providing the first Triton VX machine we
had seen [reviewed in PC Pro issue 20, June '96]. This is
essentially the same system as that prototype, but with different
peripherals - a 15in Dell monitor instead of 17in, Altec Lansing
ACS5 speakers (without subwoofer) as also supplied with the Mesh
system this month, and a smaller hard disk.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Like its predecessor, this system disappoints.
Dell doesn't install device drivers for the VX chipset's
bus-mastering EIDE controller, nor the special &quot;Triton
2&quot; Host-PCI and PCI-ISA controllers. The Western Digital
1.6Gb hard disk is shared with the IBM PC330 and both PCs are
relatively poor performers, which suggests the drive may be at
fault. The 15in monitor is unimpressive too; although the image
is sharp and low-resolution refresh rates are good, screen power
regulation is very poor. The keyboard is light and rather
clattery, in contrast to the quality Logitech mouse; both are
PS/2 versions. Another problem is the Sony CDU331 CD drive, which
sometimes failed to initialise as the machine started-up - a
peculiarity shared with CDOS' system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Access to the lovely minitower case is via a
side panel that is released by a single thumbscrew. There isn't
much inside: the Vibra16 sound chip is integrated into the
motherboard, so there's no separate sound card. The motherboard
is Dell's own, a neat ATX design; the CPU is cooled by the main
system fan, so the machine is quiet in operation. There are no
SIMM sockets, only two DIMM ones. The system comes with a single
16Mb SDRAM module, and wouldn't work correctly with a standard
fast-page mode DRAM module, although two SDRAM DIMMs were fine.
There's no chance of reusing old memory in this machine. The
256Kb of pipelined burst-mode cache is mounted directly on the
motherboard, too; a 512Kb cache version is available, but the
smaller model isn't upgradeable. Although the VX chipset supports
USB, the PC lacks the relevant port, which handicaps it slightly,
as there's only one serial port. As there's a mouse port, the COM
port is free, though.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Software includes Windows 95 version 950a and
MS Office 95, both of which are good to see, and a set of Dell
utilities. These include helpful online manuals, a system disk
creation tool, and the Dell Inspector. This claims to tell you
about your system, but it told us we had three parallel ports,
which is wrong. Clicking on the &quot;As originally shipped&quot;
button gave a &quot;File not found&quot; error and the program
aborted. Some more work is needed here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Dimension is a solid and well-designed PC
at a good price, but it's let down badly by poor finish detail,
and its motherboard's below-average expandability.</font></p>
