<h1><font size=5>What's so different about NT?</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Microsoft is often accused of unfairly dominating the PC software industry 
through its ownership of the best-selling operating system, Windows 3. This 
conveniently forgets that the initial success of Windows 3.0 in 1989 took 
MS as much by surprise as anyone else, and at first it had only one of their 
major applications - Excel - running under the new system.</p>
<p>Windows 1, 2, 3 and 95 all run on top of MS-DOS, which is now looking 
very dated - it was designed in the early 80s and has little support for 
modern PC features such as multiple megabytes of memory, large hard 
disks, and the multitasking of the 386 processor. Many of these limits were 
becoming restrictive even by the mid-80s, at which time Microsoft and IBM 
got together to design a succesor to DOS. The aim was to produce a 
robust, reliable OS that would run in the protected mode of the Intel 80286 
processor, offering advanced features such as smooth pre-emptive 
multitasking, a windowing graphical user interface, and an improved disk 
filing system supporting large volumes efficiently and capable of using long 
filenames - whilst still being able to run MS-DOS programs and which 
would seem familiar and friendly to user familiar with DOS and its 
commands. There was also a longer-term scheme to design the successor to 
OS/2, which would be a portable, Unix-like OS, able to run on non-Intel 
processors.</p>
<p>The result of the project was OS/2, which achieved all these goals - but at a 
price. OS/2 version 1 was designed for the 286, which was the best-selling 
PC processor at the time. Because of the design of the 286, OS/2 1 could 
only multitask OS/2 programs - it was only able to run one MS-DOS 
program at a time. Also, MS-DOS compatibility was low on the list of 
priorities for OS/2 and its &quot;DOS box&quot; was rather restrictive and could not 
run many DOS programs. This meant that anyone moving to OS/2 needed 
to replace virtually all their software with new OS/2 versions - none of 
which were available at first. The result was a Catch-22 situation: users 
wouldn't move to OS/2 because there was little software, and software 
companies wouldn't write OS/2 software because there were so few users.</p>
<p>When OS/2 proved not especially successful, Microsoft distanced itself 
from the project, but to reclaim some of their investment, they took the 
attractive front-end of OS/2 - the Program and File Managers, with their 
icons, proportional fonts and 3D-look buttons - and grafted them onto 
Windows 2. The three processor-specific versions of Windows 2 (for the 
8086, 286 and 386) were also rolled into one - Windows 3 would run on 
any PC, using the advanced features of the 386 (multitasking, memory 
management and virtual memory) if they were present, but working happily 
even if they were not.</p>
<p>Because Windows 3 ran on DOS, it could run virtually any DOS application 
- text-mode ones could even be multitasked in a window on-screen, 
allowing blocks of text to be cut and pasted between them. Windows 3 
therefore offered benefits to people upgrading to it, even before they had 
any Windows applications - a persuasive selling point. As Windows 3 was 
selling, MS abandoned development of OS/2, leaving IBM to go it alone 
with the 386-specific OS/2 2. [See box &quot;<a href="WARP_BOX.HTM">Why get Warped?</a>&quot;]</p>
<p>However, MS retained the right to &quot;OS/3&quot;, the portable Unix-killer 
successor to the Intel-only OS/2. As Windows was now their strategic 
direction, however, they re-wrote NT, removing its OS/2 graphical front 
end (the &quot;Presentation Manager&quot;) and replacing it with a port of the 
Windows GDI. The OS/2 API remains there still, and NT can still run OS/2 
1 text-mode applications - like Microsoft's network server (LAN 
Manager), relational database engine (SQL Server), and IBM mianframe 
gateway (SNA Server.) NT was also equipped with an enhanced Windows 
API - Win32. In the early days of the NT project, other members of the 
industry - notably IBM - expressed doubts that an applications company 
like MS could cope with developing a complete OS. Partly to quell these 
doubts, and partly to get the late-running project back on track, MS 
head-hunted Digital's head of OS development, Dave Cutler - the author of 
the RSX-11, the most popular OS for DEC's best-selling 16-bit 
minicomputer the PDP/11, and also the architect of VAX/VMS.</p>
<p>The first version of Windows NT was called 3.1 - partly to keep within 
certain licensing agreements covering &quot;Windows 3.1&quot; and partly because 
no-one would adopt version 1.0 of a completely new OS. NT 3.1 worked 
astonishingly well, and had few bugs - nearly none of which were fatal. 
However, most users held off until the 1.1 release, dubbed NT 3.5. This is 
smaller, faster and uses less memory than 3.1, and has proved very reliable 
and stable even under heavy use.</p>
