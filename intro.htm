<pre>Hello, welcome to my homepage and thanks for visiting!</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>This is both a personal site for those who are curious
about me and an advertisement for me in my capacity as
a freelance journalist and IT consultant.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>If you've bumped into me online somewhere, then you're
probably going to be more interested in the &quot;<a href="personal.htm">personal</a>&quot;
and &quot;<a href="links.htm">links</a>&quot; pages of this site - these will tell you a
bit more about me as a person.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>If you require computer advice, help and support, then
the &quot;<a href="prof.htm">professional</a>&quot; section may be more informative. It
will tell you about the kind of work that I do and the
various types of computer that I support.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>In brief - my services include designing, implementing
and supporting PC and Macintosh systems both in stand-
alone and network environments - business, charity and
home/personal.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>This includes advice about the Internet, especially in
the areas of email and web access for small businesses
and charitable organizations. I do not do web design -
this site excepted! Today, there are many professional
individuals and companies specializing in this area. I
can, however, help you to find such services.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I also write about such matters for both technical and
non-technical audiences - my work has appeared in most
of the UK's major computer magazines.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I don't solely do computers: I also cover other things
including science fiction literary criticism.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>This site also contains an <a href="contents.htm">archive</a> of almost all of my
published work. Copyright restrictions mean that it is
not totally complete, and it may not be completely up-
to-date, but I'll post as much as I can.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>In online communication you may notice a penchant that
I have for fully-justified text such as that which you
are reading now. If you look carefully you will notice
that it contains no &quot;white space&quot; - additional gaps in
between words to pad the lines out.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>This effect requires a monospaced font such as Courier,
Lucida Console or Monaco. If your machine or browser is
not equipped with an appropriate font this may not work
correctly; you may be able to correct this by adjusting
your web browser's preferences appropriately.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>Unless your browser window's very narrow this text will
appear even and straight down the right and left sides.</tt></pre>
