            align="left"></strong>This page was built using various
        WYSIWYG Web editors. Initial construction was using Claris
        HomePage 1 and 2 for Windows 95/NT. Further maintenance is with
        Microsoft (well, Vermeer really) FrontPage 1.1, 97 and 98, which
        is more powerful but less intuitive.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In places the HTML has been fine-tuned by hand,
        but generally, I no more wish to construct a site using Notepad
        than I would do DTP by writing PostScript instead of using
        PageMaker .</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The words were mostly written in Microsoft Word,
        but also WordPerfect, StarOffice, ClarisWorks, LyX and Ameol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Images were scanned with a <a
          href="http://www.logitech.com">Logitech</a> ScanMan and
        processed with the excellent Paint Shop Pro from <a
          href="http://www.jasc.com">JASC</a>. </font></p>
