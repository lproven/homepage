<h3><font size=3>Verdict: An early sample of Dell's latest Triton VX based machine. 
It's thoughtfully designed although its overall performance 
disappointing. </font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Issue 19 of PC Pro looked at Dell's first 200MHz Pentium Pro machine, 
and concluded that although it was the fastest PC we've seen, at nearly 
&#163;4,000 and limited to Windows NT and 32-bit applications, it wasn't for 
everyone. Instead, this month, we have a first look at a prototype of its new 
Triton VX-based 166MHz Pentium system.</p>
<p>This month's Labs cover a range of 166MHz Pentiums, but apart from one 
sluggish SIS-based machine, these are all built around Intel's Triton chipset. 
Version 1 of Triton is officially known as the 430FX PCIset, and machines 
based around it are on average some 15% faster than those based around 
other manufacturers' PCI chipsets. In contrast, this is the first PC we've seen 
with the new Triton VX chipset, which Intel claims will be faster than the 
current FX chipset. There are two new &quot;Tritons&quot;: the 430VX and 430HX, 
aimed at the home and business markets respectively. Both of these have 
two main advantages: firstly, support for the Universal Serial Bus (USB), a 
replacement for the current mish-mash of connectors used to connect 
external devices to PCs. Secondly, they support Concurrent PCI, which 
allows the processor to communicate with RAM simultaneously with a 
bus-mastering PCI device, giving smoother audio and video playback. 
However, for this to work under Windows 95, it will require a 
bus-mastering EIDE device driver - the standard EIDE driver isn't, and Dell 
didn't supply anything else.</p>
<p>The VX chipset concentrates on performance and economy: it can be used 
with a new type of RAM, Synchronous DRAM or SDRAM, which is even 
faster than EDO. Also, for building ultra-cheap PCs, it allows part of the 
system's main RAM to be used as graphics memory, saving the cost of 
dedicated graphics memory in low-cost PCs, and is claimed to offer good 
performance without secondary cache.</p>
<p>The motherboard is a special Dell version of the new Intel Terminator - 
apart from the VX chipset, it boasts two DIMM sockets rather than the 
usual four SIMMs. As the Pentium's memory bus is 64 bits wide, it needs 
64-bit memory; since conventional SIMMs are only 32 bits wide, this 
means they have to be added in pairs. DIMMs are basically 64-bit SIMMs, 
so they can be added individually, and either SDRAM or EDO DRAM 
DIMMs can be used.</p>
<p>Dell has revamped its case: to gain access to the interior, you simply undo a 
single thumbscrew and remove a panel on the left hand side of the machine, 
rather than lifting off the whole lid. Inside, things are neat. Except for serious 
audiophiles, there's no need for a sound card, as there's a Creative Labs 
Vibra16 chip on the motherboard, with sound jacks and a joystick port on 
the rear panel. This gives good sound effects playback, but the MIDI 
samples aren't very convincing. The noises come from punchy Altec Lansing 
speakers, complete with subwoofer - good for computer-generated sound, 
such as games, but not so hot for music playback.</p>
<p>The only expansion card is a Number Nine Imagine 128 Series 1 graphics 
card. It's still the only 128-bit graphics accelerator for PCs, and is very fast 
in 16.7 million colours - but not in 256 colour mode, which is what the PC 
Pro benchmarks run in. Soon, the series 2 I128 will be shipping, which is 
claimed to be just as fast in lower colour depths, and will also have 3D and 
video playback acceleration. As one of Number Nine's staunchest 
supporters, Dell will surely ship this once it becomes generally available, but 
for now, the machine's benchmark scores are pulled down by this card. 
Dell's supplied screen is a rebadged Nokia 17in monitor. It's a good, sharp 
display, adjusted entirely through on-screen menus, including brightness and 
contrast.</p>
<p>This machine came with a standard Microsoft two-button mouse, instead of 
Dell's usual - and preferable - rebadged Logitech. The keyboard's a Dell 
QuietKey, which is rattly but an improvement over their older, softer one. 
Both connect through PS/2 ports, as this machine doesn't have a USB port 
- yet.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that this machine is an early sample of Dell's new 
Triton VX based systems, and still needs some fine tuning in terms of 
performance. Although the potential for impressive performance exists with 
the new Triton VX chipset and SDRAM DIMMs, we really didn't see any 
evidence of this in our tests. With a version 2 Imagine and new device 
drivers, shipping machines' overall speed will probably significantly improve. 
However, at the moment, the Dimension is an interesting machine in terms of 
new technology, and is thoughtfully designed, but doesn't deliver where it 
counts. </p>

<p><font size=4>Box: &quot;Triton 2&quot; </font></p>
<p>The power of the Pentium processor makes it the CPU of choice for 
modern PCs, but that power is wasted unless the processor can 
communicate speedily and efficiently with the rest of the system. This is 
managed by the &quot;glue logic&quot; on the motherboard, and the best such chipset 
at the moment is Intel's Triton FX. The name is Intel's internal codename - 
it's officially known as the 430FX PCIset, succeeding the older NX 
&quot;Neptune&quot; and LX &quot;Mercury&quot; designs. Triton FX-based Pentium PCs are 
on average some 15% faster than those based around other PCI chipsets 
from Opti, VIA and SIS.</p>
<p>On 12th February, Intel introduced two new chipsets in the 430 family: the 
VX and HX, aimed at the home and business markets respectively. Both of 
these feature two main advantages: support for the Universal Serial Bus 
(USB) and Concurrent PCI. USB is a replacement for the current 
mish-mash of connectors used on PCs for modems, printers, monitors, 
keyboards and mice. Concurrent PCI allows the processor to communicate 
with RAM and ISA devices simultaneously with a busmastering PCI device, 
offering smoother audio and video playback. For this to work under 
Windows 95, it will require a bus-mastering EIDE driver - Microsoft's 
standard Triton IDE driver isn't, so this will require extra work from 
manufacturers.</p>
<p>The HX chipset addresses some of the drawbacks of the FX, providing 
dual processor support, memory error-checking and correction, and up to 
512Mb of RAM (four times the maximum of the FX). In contrast, the VX 
chipset concentrates on performance and economy: it allows part of the 
system's main RAM to be used as graphics memory, saving the cost of 
dedicated graphics memory in low-cost PCs, can be used with the new 
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) which is even faster than EDO, and is 
claimed to offer good performance without a secondary cache. Essentially, 
ultra-cheap PCs could be configured with no secondary cache or video 
memory, whilst high-performance machines benefit from faster main 
memory.</p>
