<h1><font size=5>Iiyama MF-8617E VisionMaster 17</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A sound, if basic, choice - a clear display, good connectivity 
and controls which are almost over-simple </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;575</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Iiyama 01483-745482</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Iiyama monitors are a popular choice, many PC manufacturers bundling the 
17in models. There are two models - this standard version, and the &#163;75 
dearer Pro model with a Trinitron screen, but the shadow-mask version is 
still crisp and sharp, with a better-than-average 0.26mm dot pitch. The 
viewable area is a reasonable 400mm from corner to corner, and is fairly flat 
and square, but like many others, the anti-reflective coating isn't particularly 
effective and merely turns the reflections purple.</p>
<p>Both Iiyamas are equipped with both kinds of connector, the ordinary 
SVGA D-Sub and five separate BNC connectors. Unusually, Iiyama 
supplied us with both types of cable, so we used the BNC, as this gives 
slightly better picture quality. One side-effect of the BNC cable is that 
Windows 95's VESA DCC autodetection doesn't work - the BNC cable 
doesn't have the data lines of the D-Sub, which the monitor uses to identify 
itself to the computer. However, the VisionMaster 17 is on Windows 95's 
standard list, so we chose it manually, and were rewarded with a sharp and 
steady picture with an 85MHz refresh rate.</p>
<p>All adjustments are made via on-screen menus, even brightness and 
contrast, which is irritating. The menus are simple to operate, but there are 
only three buttons - menu, plus and minus - which is fiddly. Other factors are 
acceptable: the stand pivots easily, and the cables are recessed by nearly 
10cm - they're tricky to insert, but the unit will sit flush against a wall. 
Generally, it's a good monitor, but not quite as sharp as the only slightly 
costlier Pro model.</p>
