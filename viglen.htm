<h3><font size="3">Supplier: Viglen 0181 758 7000</font></h3>
<h3><font size="3">Price: &#163;2,324.10</font></h3>
<h3><font size="3">Verdict: A well-built PC, but Viglen&#146;s
cut corners with sound, graphics and hard disk, so not
recommended unless you specify the best components yourself.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Viglen is one of the oldest PC builders in Britain, starting
out in the Acorn BBC Micro business in the early 80s. More
recently, it has been acquired by Amstrad, and now functions as
Amstrad&#146;s PC division. </p>
<p>The Genie 166 is assembled from a selection of big-name parts,
with only a few minor economies. The heart of the machine is all
Intel: a Pentium processor in an Endeavour board. This is the
no-frills Endeavour, without sound or graphics - instead it has
separate cards: a Matrox Millennium and a SoundBlaster AWE32. The
Matrox card is a 2Mb unit, but it uses a 175MHz RAMDAC, limiting
it to lower refresh rates than the standard 220MHz version. The
AWE32 is also unusual: the normal model has a single IDE port and
2 SIMM sockets for storing extra sound samples. This board has
the old-fashioned trinity of proprietary CD-ROM interfaces (Sony,
Mitsumi and Panasonic) and has no SIMM sockets for storing extra
sound samples. The AWE sounds good on sample playback, but MIDI
sounds poor next to Gateway&#146;s Ensoniq.</p>
<p>In terms of build quality, this machine is reasonable. The
case is Viglen&#146;s own design, although it&#146;s much like
any other mini-tower. The interior is uncluttered, but you need
to remove the 3&#189;in drive cage - a simple operation - to
access the SIMM slots. The CPU has no fan mounted on it, but
there&#146;s one close to it, mounted on the chassis. On the
front panel, there&#146;s a bulge which contains activity lights,
keyboard lock and reset button. It&#146;s good to see a reset
button that needs a pen to trigger, rather than an accidental
knock, although it&#146;s odd that there&#146;s a bulge labelled
Turbo, but no button. Modern PCs don&#146;t need a turbo button,
so why bother to label the gap?</p>
<p>Performance wasn&#146;t great; the Viglen is held back by its
Seagate hard disk, and a gigabyte, although a lot, is less than
most others supplied. However, the machine is still quick,
particularly excelling at playback of AVI and MPEG movies from
CD. Sound is delivered through a pair of QuickShot speakers,
which are loud, but tinny. The AWE32 sound card is fine for
games, but without onboard RAM potential not so good for music
enthusiasts. Outside the case is a good, clicky Acer keyboard,
and an MS Mouse II. It seems odd to find a company of
Amstrad/Viglen&#146;s size and age still using AT keyboards and
serial mice, rather than PS/2 equivalents. The monitor is branded
Viglen, and is a good, sharp screen, with friendly on-screen
menus controlled by intuitive buttons - which include separate
ones for brightness and contrast.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a competent but unexciting PC. 166MHz
Pentium-class machines are currently top-of-the-line machines,
and we don&#146;t expect to see even small cost-cutting measures
like this. With a few better components, though, this would be a
choice PC.</p>
