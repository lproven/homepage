<h1><font size=5>Iiyama MT-9017E VisionMaster Pro 17</font></h1>

<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Not the finest example of this model PC Pro has seen, but 
still one of the best on test. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;649</font></h3>

<hr>
<p>This, the second Iiyama this month, is the more sophisticated Pro version. It 
comes equipped with a Mitsubishi Diamondtron aperture-grill screen, as 
opposed to the more conventional shadow-mask of the standard model.</p>
<p>Aside from the Diamondtron screen, there's little practical difference from 
the more basic model; the casing and controls are unchanged. Aperture grill 
screens are only curved horizontally, so the screen is flatter and has 15mm 
more visible area, and the image is slightly sharper due to the finer 0.25mm 
grill pitch. The on-screen menus and adjustments are the same, which is a 
pity - the more expensive screen particularly would benefit from additional, 
finer controls, such as linearity and bow. The slim manual is shared by both 
models, with special entries for the areas where they differ. It's terse, but 
covers most of the important areas - although it omits the handy 
troubleshooting tip of checking the video card is correctly fitted.</p>
<p>Like the other Iiyama, when using the BNC connectors, Windows 95 can't 
detect the monitor type. However, even with a D-Sub cable, the Pro model 
isn't on Windows' list of monitor types; Iiyama have a &quot;driver&quot;, a small 
MONITOR.INF file which tells Windows the resolutions it can display, but 
this wasn't supplied: we had to fetch it from <a href="http://www.iiyama.com">Iiyama's web site</a>. With this, you 
also gain the handy 1152x864 mode.</p>
<p>All monitors vary slightly, even individual ones from the same range, and this 
is one of the poorer VisionMaster Pros we've seen. It needed slight 
adjustments to its geometry and linearity, but it lacks the necessary controls, 
so it fell down slightly in testing; this is a pity, as many manufacturers supply 
Iiyamas and we've seen plenty of them. Nonetheless, it's a very good price 
for a Trinitron-type screen, and is worth buying.</p>
