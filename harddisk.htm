<h1><font size=4>Hard disk interfaces: SCSI versus EIDE</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>As PCs get more powerful, so the subsystems in a PC must run faster to 
keep data moving at high speed. And since all that data either comes from 
or ends up on a disk drive somewhere, the interface between the system bus 
and the disks becomes a critical bottleneck. In most modern systems, this 
interface will be one of two kinds &#150; EIDE or SCSI.</p>
<p><b>EIDE</b></p>
<p>The Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics system was developed from the 
IDE system. As the name suggests, IDE drives have the main disk controller 
circuitry built into the drive itself; the drive connects straight to the system 
bus with no need for a separate controller on the bus, reducing the 
computer&#146;s cost. The specification for the interface is called the AT 
Attachment (ATA), from IBM&#146;s original PC-AT (for Advanced 
Technology), the origin of the 16-bit ISA bus. IDE refers to the hard disks 
themselves, not the interface, and non-hard disk ATA devices such as 
CD-ROM drives shouldn&#146;t be called EIDE but rather ATAPI (ATA Packet 
Interface). Enhanced IDE is a newer specification for hard disks bigger than 
528Mb, and also covers dual-channel systems and non-hard disk ATAPI 
peripherals. The original ATA spec was for connecting drives to the ISA 
bus; EIDE systems usually use the newer ATA-2 or Fast ATA interface, 
which connects to a local bus instead. The latest revision is UltraATA, 
which promises to double the transfer speed again to 33MByte/s and adds 
error-checking to the interface, but current PC chipsets don&#146;t support it.</p>
<p>The ATA specification allows for only 2 devices per interface, one &quot;master&quot; 
and one &quot;slave;&quot; although EIDE allows for up to 4 channels and eight 
devices, most PCs have only two channels.. However, some problems are 
that mixing old, slow devices with new, faster ones can limit that channel to 
the speed of the slower device, and that only one device per channel can be 
accessed at once.</p>
<p>To read or write data from an EIDE drive, the computer specifies the block 
it requires to the drive&#146;s onboard controller, which reads the data and places 
it on the system bus, usually in 4KB blocks. In normal Programmed I/O 
operation, the CPU reads each block, stores it in memory, comes back for 
the next, and so on. In a fast computer, this can give transfer rates of up to 
16.6MB/sec, but it requires a lot of work by the CPU, which in a 
multitasking system could be doing other things. Many drives now support 
DMA operation as well, where the drive takes over the bus (bus-mastering) 
and places data straight into RAM using direct memory access (DMA.) This 
is better for multitasking PCs as the CPU can get on with other work while 
data transfer occurs, although only in Triton HX and VX-based systems can 
the CPU use the memory or ISA buses while the PCI bus is in use.</p>
<p><b>SCSI</b></p>
<p>The main alternative interface for storage devices in PCs and many other 
systems is SCSI. The SCSI-1 standard was agreed in 1986, and there have 
been a confusing numbers of different versions and variants since then - 
SCSI-1, SCSI-2, Fast and/or Wide SCSI, UltraSCSI and SCSI-3. All 
share a number of basic features. Unlike EIDE, SCSI is a separate bus, 
which requires an interface to connect it to the PC&#146;s PCI or ISA bus. This 
isn&#146;t a controller &#150; it&#146;s correctly called a <i>host adaptor</i>. The actual 
controllers are built into each SCSI device and also serve to connect the 
device to the shared SCSI bus. Each device is distinguished by a unique ID 
number from 0 to 7; traditionally, the host adaptor is ID 7. The bus is linear, 
and the host adaptor can go anywhere &#150; at either end, or in the middle. 
There&#146;s no relationship between IDs and the physical position on the bus, 
but both ends must be terminated to prevent signals being reflected back 
along the bus. Termination can be either passive, by plugging a passive 
terminator (essentially a block of 136 Ohm resistors) onto the end of the 
cable, or active, which is usually set by changing a jumper or software 
setting on the devices at each ends.</p>
<p>SCSI-1 is the original version, and is now obsolete. It defined a parallel 
8-bit bus with a signalling rate of 5MHz, which could therefore transfer 5 
Megabytes every second. It was intended to allow up to 8 devices &#150; the 
host adaptor and up to 7 hard disks. SCSI-1 host adaptors are very rare 
now, and there&#146;s no good reason to use them, but most SCSI-1 devices will 
work happily on a SCSI-2 system.</p>
<p>SCSI-2 was a major change. It added specifications for attaching devices 
other than hard disks to a SCSI bus, such as CD-ROM drives, scanners, 
optical drives, media changers and other devices such as printers, Ethernet 
interfaces and even graphics adaptors. It also added two optional speed 
improvements &#150; doubling the signalling rate to 10MHz (Fast SCSI), and 
adding a second &quot;P&quot; cable to the SCSI bus, allowing 16 or 32-bit data 
transfers (Wide SCSI.) These two options can be used separately or 
combined in Fast and Wide SCSI. Wide SCSI also doubles the permitted 
number of devices to 16.</p>
<p>After SCSI-2, things get confusing! SCSI-3 is a far broader standard than 
its predecessor, covering various different physical connections. It&#146;s best 
thought of as a communications protocol, and some manufactures misuse the 
term SCSI-3 to refer to enhanced SCSI-2 products. Relative to existing 
SCSI-2 installations, probably the most important change in SCSI-3 is the 
introduction of a single cable for Wide SCSI devices rather than the pair of 
cables in Wide SCSI-2. Another major improvement is SCAM (SCSI 
Configuration Auto-Magically.) SCAM allows for self-configuring SCSI 
devices that select their own ID number, rather than the manual assignment 
of IDs in SCSI-1 and 2. It also allows auto-termination.</p>
<p>UltraSCSI is strictly an extension of SCSI-2. It doubles the signalling rate 
again, to 20MHz, at the cost of shortening the overall length of the SCSI 
bus to 1.5M. Since most implementations of Wide SCSI are 16-bit, Wide 
UltraSCSI is the fastest version for now, at a theoretical maximum of 
40MB/sec.</p>

<p><b>Which is better?</b></p>
<p>Both SCSI and EIDE have distinct advantages. EIDE is cheap and fairly 
easy, with only one setting &#150; master/slave &#150; to worry about, but only allows 
4 devices, mainly limited top hard disks and CD-ROMs. SCSI allows up to 
15 devices on one interface, and in a multitasking system, several can be 
accessed at once, but it costs more and can getting IDs and termination set 
up correctly can be tricky.</p>
