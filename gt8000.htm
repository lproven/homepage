<p>Verdict: A solid scanner with respectable performance, supported by an 
excellent bundle, but it faces stiff competition from the cheaper HP 4P.</p>
<p>The 8500 is Epson's mid-range flatbed, aimed at professional business 
users. It offers a higher 400ppi resolution that the 5000, and samples at a 
colour depth of 30 bits rather that 24, which should enable it to pick up 
more detail at the extremes of its range, in very dark and light areas. The 
greater information bandwidth makes it slightly slower in operation, though. 
It's considerably larger, and has a broader range of connections - both 
parallel and SCSI ports, plus connectors for an optional sheetfeeder and 
transparency adaptor. Also in the box is an Adaptec 1505 ISA SCSI 
controller. This isn't plug and play, but is a reasonable card, and could 
support other SCSI devices.</p>
<p>The 8500 uses the same driver software as the other models - a 
comprehensive scanner control and operation package with three main 
components. Epson SCAN! II itself is a utility to acquire and save images 
from the scanner. It doesn't offer any image manipulation facilities, but 
allows you to get an original into a file on disk without any other software. 
Configuring the scanner is accomplished with a Control Panel applet called 
Epson Scanners, which allows the user to choose the scanner interface 
(parallel or ASPI SCSI), then searches out, identifies and tests any Epson 
devices on that interface. Finally, both 16- and 32-bit TWAIN drivers are 
supplied. Functionally identical, they offer a wide range of controls over the 
scanning process and the resulting image, including an automatic 
self-optimising mode that attempts to work out the best settings unaided. 
Almost all the complexity can be hidden away in an optional &quot;easy&quot; mode, in 
which you need only choose the type of image (colour or mono photo, line 
art etc.) and the output device (screen, generic printer types and a list of 
Epson printers), and the driver automatically sets the appropriate 
parameters (such as colour depth and resolution) for you.</p>
<p>The device connected easily to our Adaptec PCI card using a standard 
cable, with a port spare for a terminator to be attached. Although Windows 
95 detected it immediately, as with the other Epsons, no 95 driver was 
provided, so the device remained flagged with a warning yellow question 
mark in the &quot;Other devices&quot; section. This doesn't affect its operation, but is 
irritating, and it's time more scanner manufacturers supported proper 
plug-and-play operation. </p>
<p>The 8500 gave good results on the OCR and colour photo tests, but was 
slower than both its siblings and like them got a poor score for colour 
accuracy. Still, it's a good unit, with helpful drivers and an excellent software 
bundle.</p>
