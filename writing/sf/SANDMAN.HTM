<p>For those who already read graphic novels, you should already know all 
about the Sandman, and you can skip the next couple of paragraphs. If you 
don't, shame on you! Read on...</p>
<p>Do you read comics? No? Think they're all about superheroes, and tend to 
be over-reliant on the word &quot;Pow!&quot;? Then you are very wrong indeed. Go 
away and read Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat immediately.</p>
<p>Right. Good, wasn't it? It serves excellently as a gentle introduction to adult 
comics for those unfamiliar with the form. By &quot;adult&quot;, I don't mean 
sex-related, either, a lamentably common assumption today. Although some 
of the traditional tropes still permeate modern comics, there is a flourishing 
genre of graphical fiction written for grown-ups, exemplified by classics such 
as Art Spiegelman's Maus and Alan Moore's V for Vendetta and 
Watchmen. Arguably greatest amongst these is Neil Gaiman's lengthy series 
of stories about the Sandman &#150; yes, that one: Morpheus, bringer of dreams 
and nightmares.</p>
<p>The Sandman stories have been appearing as individual comics since 1988, 
and have been a showcase for many of the best artists in the field: Bryan 
Talbot, Charles Vess, and Steve Leialoha to name a few personal 
favourites. The different artists have illustrated many tales, all scripted in 
painstaking detail by Gaiman: despite the diverse styles, there is always a 
strong unifying theme, supported by Dave McKean's surreally haunting 
covers and frontispieces for each chapter. However, for me, they work best 
in the form of bound graphic novels, with the individual comics edited into 
coherent books.</p>
<p>Volume by volume, they chronicle the existence of Dream, younger brother 
to Death, eldest of the Endless: Desire, Destiny, Despair, Delirium (n&eacute;e 
Delight) and Destruction. The history starts with the capture and 
imprisonment of Dream by a sorcerer for over 70 years; in his absence, the 
Kingdom of Dream crumbles, and so begins the fall of its King. Over the 
next 69 issues, Gaiman's saga roams far and wide: there are many separate 
&quot;story arcs&quot;, some of which relate only peripherally to Dream himself.</p>
<p>Early on it's hinted that even the so-called Endless can die, and there's a 
growing sense that Dream must fall. The Kindly Ones is the climax of that 
fall, but &#150; ever producing the unexpected &#150; Gaiman's afterword reveals that 
it isn't the last Sandman book, and that volume nine, The Wake, will follow. 
In this book, a conspiracy is made against Dream, the agent of his doom 
being the Furies &#150; who are so feared that it's bad luck to name them so, and 
are therefore called the Eumenides &#150; the friendly, or kindly, ones. With 
delicious irony, the unknowing conspirators use the (apparent) death of the 
boy Daniel to fuel the Furies' rage...</p>
<p>As always, there's a lot left unsaid in Gaiman's writing, and to describe any 
more of the story would be to give the game away. Yet even knowing the 
broad outlines of what's to come &#150; guessable by any avid reader &#150; doesn't 
reveal all. To this reader at least, it's unclear how much Dream knows of his 
future, and although he certainly planned some of it, it's hard to tell how 
much. It's a small consolation that Death herself doesn't know either. No 
more do I know what's coming next, no matter how hard I wish that I did.</p>
<p>Tying together many of the threads from the earlier books, this penultimate 
eighth volume of the Sandman series is the biggest of all. For me, it was a 
particular pleasure to encounter the stylish designs of D'Israeli, the D'emon 
D'raughtsman, creator of &quot;Timulo&quot; in Deadline magazine (of fond memory), 
and the crisp, sharp lines of Glyn Dillon. It's essential reading for any 
follower of the story so far, and though some might be ready to stop here, 
the beckoning of &quot;just one more&quot; is very strong. For a reader not already 
familiar with Sandman, though, it would be fearfully hard work, and most of 
the resonances would inevitably be missed. Tragically, soon it will all be 
over; Sandman book nine will be the last. I can hardly wait. </p>
