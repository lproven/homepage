<p>Or - if you aren&#146;t yet familiar with haqrese<sup>[1]</sup> - &quot;Cool, dude!&quot; After reading 
this book, if you can&#146;t at least <i>pretend </i>to be a hacker, you&#146;re a rancid 
lamer<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
<p>The Net is growing in significance every day, but as it spreads its tendrils 
throughout the lives of much of the developed world, its original denizens are 
being left high and dry. When the Net was young and text-based, the haqrs 
who owned it were rebellious kids, reveling in their superior knowledge of 
UNIX arcana and developing their own subculture. This is, guessably, much 
involved with the youth culture of rich young North Americans, often 
rebellious teenagers whose mastery of the systems was matched with a 
certain degree of scholastic and social inadequacy. Thus, a new dialect of 
English, based around intentional misspellings, abbreviations, cryptic 
computer references and so on. This evolved, as rapidly as anything 
involved with computers, in a context of purely text-based, nonlinear, 
non-real-time communication, where everything can potentially be 
overheard, so impenetrable obscurity is a positive boon. Off the Net, the 
haquer community developed other peculiarites, of dress (from nerdy 
&quot;I-don&#146;t-care-how-I-look&quot; to Gothic &quot;all-that-matters-is-how-I-look&quot;), 
&quot;challenging&quot; hairstyles, attitude and behaviour, recognition signals, 
recreational activities, and even diet (ramen, twinkies and Jolt cola.)</p>
<p>And now, it&#146;s all fading away in the bright harsh light of the World Wide 
Web: the Internet for all, made so easy to operate that the newbies are 
taking over. The time is nigh to document this disappearing culture along 
with the aboriginal indians, and R. U. Sirius and &quot;Saint&quot; Jude Milhon are just 
the people to do it. Part of the original teams behind <i>Wired, Mondo2000</i> 
and <i>bOING bOING</i> (seminal Infobahn zines all), these guys are definitely 
members of the elite. No-one seems to be quite sure what Bart Nagel&#146;s 
doing in there, but it&#146;s probably something dull but important like checking 
that most of the words are spelled correctly and in roughly the conventional 
order.</p>
<p><i>The Cyberpunk Handbook</i> is a vital tool for all sorts of people. If you 
suspect that someone you know<sup>[3]</sup> may be a hacker, this will let you identify 
the signs. It won&#146;t help you do anything about it, but at least you will have 
some idea what they&#146;re on about. It will give you a brief, glancing 
introduction to deep geek psychology. It will even help a newbie take their 
first proper steps into the Big Room, and warn them away from the really 
dangerous bits. More importantly, of course, if you already are a something 
of a hacker, then it has several functions. First, it will tell you what level you 
are. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a Net account, Web access and an eddress? [Newbie]</li>
<li>Do you have at least three eddresses, one ISP account and several 
online service ones, know what the current version of Netscape 
Navigator is, and have a non-lame homepage? [Cyber-yup]</li>
<li>Do you roll your own Linux kernels and run an ISP? [Dude]</li>
<li>Do you have lunch with Tim Berners-Lee<sup>[4]</sup> and give definitive 
answers to RFCs? [&#145;Leet<sup>[5]</sup>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, it&#146;s a step-by-step DIY guide to upgrading your knowledge, and 
therefore cyberhood. (For instance, it lists a number of the seminal SF 
books and films that you should know.) Thirdly, you should laugh your 
nose-ring off.</p>
<p>Recommended. 4/4 shuriken<sup>[6]</sup>. OK, it&#146;s not actually science fiction, but it 
<i>talks </i>about SF. READ THIS BOOK!</p>

<p><sup><font size=2>[1]</font></sup><font size=2> Challenging spelling is part of the cool, OK?</font></p>
<p><sup><font size=2>[2]</font></sup><font size=2> Don&#146;t understand? You may be one already. Do something! QUICK!</font></p>
<p><sup><font size=2>[3]</font></sup><font size=2> Including yourself</font></p>
<p><sup><font size=2>[4]</font></sup><font size=2> What do you MEAN &quot;who&#146;s he?&quot;!</font></p>
<p><sup><font size=2>[5]</font></sup><font size=2> That&#146;s &quot;Elite&quot; to you</font></p>
<p><sup><font size=2>[6]</font></sup><font size=2> &quot;A kinda cyber-star&quot;</font></p>
