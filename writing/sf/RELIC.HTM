<p>Oh, dear. There's a terrible monster, hiding in the dark, hunting down 
unsuspecting people and eating their brains. No, really - this is actually the 
story of 'Relic'. What's more, it's the plot, too. </p>
<p>Like Red Dwarf's &quot;Grant Naylor&quot;, Lincoln Preston is actually two people. 
Douglas Preston, apparently, provided the knowledge of dinosaurs (he 
wrote a book about them once) and the New York Museum of Natural 
History; meanwhile, Lincoln Child, a horror editor, donated the knowledge 
of writing suspense. Put the duo together, and the result is a bit of a 
mish-mash: the basic storyline is predictable, right down to the traditional 
twist-in-the-tail, but its twists and turns along the way do hold some 
surprises. The monster is the whole core of the book, and it's described by 
lots of impressive-sounding scientific doubletalk, but unlike, say, 'Jurassic 
Park', there's no real science behind it.</p>
<p>They obviously did some research to obtain the jargon, but not very much: 
the idea of a half-mammal half-dinosaur monster, which has to feed on a 
strange waterlily that contains human hormones, is patently absurd; the 
evolutionary theories expounded by certain characters are nonsense; and the 
amazing computer program, the Genetic Extrapolator, which can describe 
any organism from a DNA sample, is actually impossible.</p>
<p>Since the book was obviously (ahem) &quot;inspired&quot; by Michael Crichton's 
work, it's a pity that they didn't invest the effort to make it plausible. Still, it's 
a page-turner: even while amused at the &quot;weird science&quot;, I wanted to know 
what they were going to do next. Often, I could guess - for instance, mostly, 
nice people live, nasty ones get eaten; in this book, personality failings tend 
to be fatal - but the authors' experience in suspense shows, and my 
predictions were often wrong. If you're looking for an easy read with 
occasional excitement, 'Relic' will pull you in and keep you, but if you're 
after anything more, it would be better not to start at all. What's more, like 
the plot, there's a twist in the tail of this story, too - 'Relic' is soon to be 
made into a film, a medium to which it's far better suited.</p>
