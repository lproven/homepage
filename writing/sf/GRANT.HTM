<p>It&#146;s hard to know what to say about <i>Backwards</i>. The prologue&#146;s easy: it&#146;s a 
Red Dwarf novel, by half of the team behind the TV series - Rob Grant and 
Doug Naylor, who between them also wrote the first two Red Dwarf 
novels, <i>Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers </i>and <i>Better than Life</i>. Naylor 
wrote the third book, <i>Last Human</i>, alone, and now it&#146;s Grant&#146;s turn. It&#146;s 
funny, in places hilarious &#150; at least, if you like Red Dwarf&#146;s, ahem, &quot;robust&quot; 
humour. It should be; Grant and Naylor are experienced humourists, having 
worked on <i>Spitting Image</i> amongst other things.</p>
<p>Neither of the team reveals why the partnership broke up, but it seems likely 
that Grant wanted to go his own way. The dedications suggest that 
<i>Backwards</i> was started before <i>Last Human</i>, but took longer to complete: 
reading <i>Last Human</i>, this is very believable, as that book embodied much 
of the worst of <i>Red Dwarf</i>: schoolboy humour, hallucinatorily-convoluted 
non-sensical storylines, and silly anti-scientific fantasy. Despite this, <i>SFX</i> and 
others gave it good reviews, and it would have suited one type of 
Dwarf-fan: those who loved the series for its silly funniness, not as SF. 
<i>Backwards</i> is a far more mature and well-written novel, and shows a 
possible reason for the split of the gestalt entity &quot;Grant Naylor&quot; &#150; Rob Grant 
has far greater potential that scripting Dwarf, whilst Doug Naylor has stuck 
with the BBC for the latest series, <i>Red Dwarf VIII</i>, which (judging by the 
first episode) has lost all its redeeming intelligence and style.</p>
<p>The title is deceptive: it&#146;s not just a novelisation of the famous &quot;Backwards&quot; 
episode, where Lister finally finds his way back to (an) Earth, but 
unfortunately one where the flow of time is reversed, cause following effect. 
It starts there, and adds some interesting new twists to this established idea. 
Grant&#146;s intelligent writing shines here: when Naylor invents irrational 
scenarios such as a planet with a habitable ocean underneath a layer of 
molten lava, created by an engineered <i>virus</i>, Grant displays detailed 
knowledge of feline penile anatomy. Grant explores the (quite genuine) 
theory that time need not flow in one particular dimension, and what it would 
be like for &quot;forwards&quot; beings to live in a &quot;backwards&quot; world. Later &#150; or is 
that earlier? &#150; he goes on to other Dwarf episodes, including Ace Rimmer in 
&quot;Smoke me a kipper, I&#146;ll be back for breakfast&quot; and the classic Wild West 
pastiche, together with a lot of new material. I&#146;m a fairly keen watcher of the 
series, but there&#146;s plenty here that I didn&#146;t recognise.</p>
<p>This book is a joy. The prose clearly and elegantly chronicles the ridiculous 
adventures of Lister, Rimmer, Kryten and the Cat, along with a welcome 
return for Norman Lovett&#146;s Holly. Unlike <i>Last Human</i>, the team&#146;s exploits 
hang together in a vaguely believable way, and the novel is a real 
page-turner &#150; unlike its prequel, which I waded through for the sake of 
research. Don&#146;t think that BSFA reviewers never suffer for their art. Even if 
you were put off by <i>Last Human</i>, you should give Backwards a try: it&#146;s a 
better book by far.</p>
