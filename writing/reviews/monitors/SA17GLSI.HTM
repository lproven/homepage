<h1><font size=5>Samsung SyncMaster 17GLsi</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A very good screen, but overpriced compared to the 
competition. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;699</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Samsung 0181-391-0168</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The second Samsung this month is the higher-end GLsi model. Strikingly 
similar to the lower-end model, this one has a finer 0.26mm dot pitch, a 
separate D-Sub connector with a discrete signal lead, as well as five BNC 
connectors. The drop-down control panel gains two extra buttons, too: 
colour adjustment and BNC or D-Sub input selection. Externally, that's it; 
the appearance is identical, although when you pick it up you notice an extra 
kilogram.</p>
<p>The higher-quality picture tube doesn't make a massive difference: picture 
quality is high on both, and the finer dot pitch isn't very apparent, although 
the better screen doesn't suffer as much from moir&eacute; patterning as its sibling. 
Both gave excellent results in the screen regulation test, with no visible 
movement at all, which is exceptional. The GLsi also has a higher video 
bandwidth, but the standard refresh rates are the same, so this is of little 
practical value to most users. What is more valuable is the three-year onsite 
warranty offered by Samsung; this is longer than many suppliers, and may 
be enough to justify the rather high price for some. As far as documentation 
goes, the manuals for the two models are only slightly different. Although 
they're bulked out by containing four different language versions, they are 
clear and helpful.</p>
<p>The differences between the GLi and GLsi seem comparitively minor for 
&#163;100: Iiyama manage an aperture-grill CRT for less, and the GLsi can't 
quite match that. This is a good monitor, but the cost is a little high for what 
you get. If this were the cheaper model, and there was a &#163;700 Trinitron, 
then Samsung would probably be the monitors of choice, but they are still 
worth a look.</p>
