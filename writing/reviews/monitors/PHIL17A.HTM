<h1><font size=5>Phillips Brilliance 17A</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Good design, but average image quality and lousy sound for 
the price. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;999</font></h3>

<p>Philips' entrant this month is interesting: it is one of the few &quot;multimedia 
monitors&quot; on test, in that it includes a pair of stereo loudspeakers, though no 
microphone. The speakers are amplified, but the sound quality is very harsh 
and tinny, and they are no substitute for a seperate pair for any except the 
most basic usage.</p>
<p>The screen itself is a shadow-mask design, with a fine 0.26mm dot pitch, 
but its performance on fine detail is disappointing, especially in the corners, 
and it suffers badly from moir&eacute; effects. Impressively, it can display a steady 
1280x1024 image at 75Hz, which is too high for this size of screen to 
accurately resolve individual pixels, but might be useful occasionally. It can 
also sustain 1600x1200, but this is very flickery and small details are very 
hard to see. At a more moderate 1024x768, the image is stable and sharp.</p>
<p>It is well-supplied with controls: wheels for contrast, brightness and volume. 
Although the brightness doesn't go as high as most monitors, it's enough, 
whilst the volume goes far higher than the speakers can manage. There's a 
headphone jack on the front panel, too, which is very useful in as busy 
office, and far preferable to fumbling for the sound card's. Other display 
adjustments are via on-screen menus, but they only cover the main options, 
and the menu graphics are very chunky - they badly need finer detail and 
clearer explanations.</p>
<p>All round, this is an attractive monitor with a decent display, but the 
speakers are awful, and the display isn't nearly good enough to justify the 
thousand-pound pricetag.</p>
