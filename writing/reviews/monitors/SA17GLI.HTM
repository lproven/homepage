<h1><font size=5>Samsung SyncMaster 17GLi</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A very pleasing monitor, but the price is a bit much - though 
street prices may be lower. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;599</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Samsung 0181-391-0168</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Samsung supplied two monitors for this month's Labs, both SyncMaster 
17s: this is the 17GLi, and next up is the slightly higher-specification Glsi. 
The GLi is the most basic model, but the differences are quite small: 
externally, almost the only sign is that the signal cable is captive on this 
version, and there are no BNC connectors.</p>
<p>Both units come in the same casing, which is quite small and light, although 
at over 2in the bezel around the screen is rather wider than is necessary. The 
monitor looks quite attractive, with a decorative blue strip around the edge 
of the bezel, and cutouts in the stand, which has a light action but a small 
range. The main controls - power, brightness and contrast - are on the front 
panel, with a central drop-down section for the image adjustments.</p>
<p>Although the controls are on-screen, they're not chosen from menus - there 
are separate buttons for sizing, positioning, distortion, colour control and 
finally reset and degauss. Pressing these gives an on-screen indicator which 
can be adjusted using a cursor diamond - fast and easy.</p>
<p>The monitor was correctly identified by Windows 95, but the default driver 
only offered a disappointing maximum resolution of 1024x768. As it was 
one of the screens on Matrox' supported list, we chose that, and were 
rewarded with a stable 1152x864 @ 70Hz mode and a less usable 
1280x1024 @ 60Hz. Although the shadow-mask CRT's dot pitch is only a 
coarse 0.28mm, the image was sharp and bright even at 1152 pixels across 
the screen; you could happily use this all day. </p>
<p>This is an appealing screen; its picture is good, and it looks small and 
attractive. The controls are easy and flexible. The only snag is its cost - at a 
recommended retail of just shy of &#163;600, there are better-specified screens 
for less. Shop around.</p>
