<h1><font size=5>CTX 1785XA</font></h1>

<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A keen price for a Diamondtron screen, but let down by 
poor quality control. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;599</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: CTX 01923-818461</font></h3>

<p>This is the final member of the trio of CTXs, and the top of their 17in line. 
The specifications sound good: an aperture-grill CRT with a fine 0.26mm 
dot pitch, a high maximum resolution of 1600x1200 pixels, control via 
on-screen menus, BNC connectors... the works. It even looks more 
expensive than the D and S models, with a different, curvier case, and the 
touch-pad controls hidden on a drop-down panel. And then you turn it on. 
The 85XA is one of the few screens to fail our background interference test, 
with two large areas of discolouration at left and right, and smaller ones in 
two corners. The focus tests show that the discoloured areas are matched 
by larger areas of very bad focus, where the pixels are blurred. To be fair, 
where the picture is clear, it's very sharp and clear - but that's only half of 
the screen. The only thing that's clear all over the screen is the operator's 
reflection. Obviously, this screen's more than usually defective, or the range 
wouldn't be on sale. However, PC Pro's sister magazine MacUser was also 
conducting a monitor labs at the same time as us, and we examined their 
CTX 1785XA which exhibited similar problems, so it's not unique.</p>
<p>The poor quality of the display is a shame, because otherwise this is a 
pleasing monitor: the build quality is generally good, with helpful controls and 
a shapely</p>
<p>case with cables that, though not recessed by very much, shelter under an 
overhanging rear. The stand has an easy action and swivels just over 90&#176; in 
each direction, which is exceptional. If you are able to check the quality of 
the picture on your individual unit, it should be a good buy, but if not, take 
care.</p>
