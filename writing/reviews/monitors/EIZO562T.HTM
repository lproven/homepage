<p>Eizo, which has an enviable reputation for high-end professional monitors, 
submitted three screens from its range of four 17in models this month, and 
the T562-T is the most expensive of that trio. Big, square and plain with a 
very flat Trinitron CRT, it's an imposing unit, and one of the heaviest on test.</p>
<p>The Eizo is unusual in several ways. One obvious sign is the appearance of 
the screen. On most monitors, the bezel covers the edge of the display area, 
so images can go right up to the edge of the visible screen. Eizo's bezel ends 
some 5mm away from the edge of the screen phosphors, so you can see 
absolutely all of the screen - although this means there's a permanent black 
border around the edge of the screen. The controls are also idiosyncratic, 
with a single &quot;select&quot; button and a rotary dial for making adjustments. This 
controls an on-screen menu system that covers all the standard options 
except, irritatingly, linearity, bow and parallelogram. The monitor beeps to 
indicate menu choices and to indicate when an adjustment reaches its 
maximum or minimum, can operate in five languages, and even has help for 
some options. Most of the main functions also have separate buttons to save 
navigating the menus. When the menus aren't displayed, the dial acts as a 
contrast control. Oddly, Plug 'n' Play compliance is implemented via a 
&quot;dongle&quot; that fits between the signal cable and the video card.</p>
<p>The display is very clear and sharp, but suffers slightly from geometric 
distortion, especially in one corner. Also, it had slight problems with 
bleeding and ghosting, which is suprising. However, it's a very desirable 
monitor, and is one of the best overall this month.</p>
