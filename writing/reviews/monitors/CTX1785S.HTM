<h3><font size=3>Verdict: &#163;50 more gets you a higher-spec screen and menu controls, 
but not a significantly better image. </font></h3>

<p>This is the second of our trio of CTX screens, representing one of their 
mid-range units. It comes in the same case as the 1765D, complete with 
captive signal lead and no BNC connectors. The main differences are that 
the 85 models have a finer 0.26mm dot pitch screen which can run at up to 
1600x1200, and the S which indicates on-screen menu controls. These are 
good: there are separate keys to enter and exit the menus, along with 
up/down and plus/minus adjusters. You don't have to enter submenus to 
adjust each parameter, which makes using CTX's menus faster than most 
others, such as Iiyama's fiddly equivalents.</p>
<p>The display itself is a bit of a disappointment; it suffers from linearity and 
moir&eacute; problems, for which there are no adjustments. Despite the fine dot 
pitch, the image lacks sharpness and clarity; although it's not bad enough to 
fail our tests, it doesn't look as crisp as some others. When the brightness 
was adjusted correctly according to our test software, it was right on its 
minimum, and the screen looked quite dim - signs that the sub-brightness 
scale needed adjustment, which also isn't on the menus.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the monitor was correctly recognised by Windows, 
and gave a stable, flicker-free image at all 1024x768, 1152x864, 
1280x1024 and 1600x1200, which is impressive. The higher two modes 
only sustained 65Hz, but this is still good for a 17-incher. The slim manual is 
helpful and informative, although there are only minor differences between 
the booklets for the three monitors - CTX might be better advised to 
produce one general manual, like NEC.</p>
<p>The additional cost of this over the 65D model is modest, for the 
higher-resolution screen and better controls, but the higher-specification 
screen shows its low-cost nature more. It's a better monitor, but only by a 
hair's-breadth.</p>
