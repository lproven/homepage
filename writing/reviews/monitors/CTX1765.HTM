<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A modest but very reasonable screen for a bargain price </font></h3>

<p>CTX - sometimes also known as Chuntex - monitors are a familiar sight in 
PC Pro Labs; its 15in models are rebadged by many suppliers such as 
Amstrad and Dan. It submitted three screens this month: the 1765D, 1785S 
and 1785XA. The manuals refer to a 1785D and 1765S too, so they have 
quite a range. The 1765D is a basic model: it has a shadow-mask screen, 
and unusally this month, no on-screen menus, relying on four pairs of control 
buttons instead. These are simple and intuitive to use, although more 
specialised adjustments require you to press the mode button first, which 
isn't obvious. Omitting the extra circuitry for on-screen menus should reduce 
the cost somewhat. </p>
<p>The 65 or 85 on the end of the model numbers denote the dot pitch: the 65s 
are 0.28mm, whilst the 85s are 0.26mm. Although this model has the most 
basic CRT, image quality is good. Like most, it couldn't show 1-pixel 
vertical lines accurately at 1024x768, but focus and resolution were 
otherwise good. It had problems with moir&eacute; patterning on large dithered 
areas, and there's no adjustment available for this. Also, it exhibited 
streaking and ghosting on high-contrast screens, but this isn't uncommon and 
is seldom intrusive. There's little else to criticise, but the anti-reflective 
coating isn't much use: on a dark screen, the operator can clearly see their 
own reflection.</p>
<p>The casing is plain, angular and quite nondescript: the adjustment buttons are 
in a groove beneath the screen, and the back is a plain square with a label in 
the middle. The cables are neatly recessed, but the captive signal lead is a 
common drawback on budget models. The stand pivots a full 90&#176; in either 
direction, which is good.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of on-screen menus is worth it - you get a lot of screen for 
your money, and its quality is enough for general use. </p>
