<p>Aydin are one of the less familiar names this month, although you may see 
their screens with other companies' names on the front - the manual even 
details how to change the name displayed on the on-screen menus.</p>
<p>It's a small, light unit, one of the most compact on test. The screen is a 
shadow-mask design, with a 0.28mm dot pitch, which is about the coarsest 
acceptable for a 17in display, but it manages a usable 1280x1024 
resolution, albeit at a flickery 60Hz. Windows 95's VESA autodetection 
found the screen but couldn't identify it by name, and no driver was supplied 
- still, it worked fine and offered a choice of modes and refresh rates that 
worked acceptably. Unfortunately, this didn't include our preferred 
1152x864 mode, and we couldn't fake it by overriding Windows' monitor 
selection with the Matrox utility; the screen just blanked at the intermediate 
resolution.</p>
<p>The display is best at 1024x768, with a comfortable 75Hz refresh. The 
image is sharp and clear, but in testing, the background interference test 
revealed a bright line down one side. Most of the tests gave acceptable 
results, but like the Wyse, this unit fell down badly on screen regulation. 
There were also problems with linearity, moir&eacute; and ghosting, which would 
disqualify it from intense graphical work.</p>
<p>The on-screen menu system is rather basic too, with large, blocky graphics 
that occupy nearly a third of the screen, and include brightness and contrast 
controls, which is a pain. However, within its limits, the display is good, and 
the anti-glare coating is one of the best on test, with a faint matt finish that 
disperses reflections very effectively.</p>
<p>The main impression given by this monitor is of a basic, budget unit, but it's 
about &#163;10 more than the far superior Iiyama VisionMaster 17.</p>
