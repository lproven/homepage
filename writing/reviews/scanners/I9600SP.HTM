<h1><font size=5>Trust Imagery 9600SP</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: 01376-501146 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Despite reasonable bundled software, there&#146;s little to 
recommend this large and ponderous unit. </font></h3>
<hr>
<p>This own-make model is the second of Trust&#146;s scanners this month, and 
represents their higher-end model. It&#146;s a large and imposing desktop unit, 
and like all this month&#146;s flatbeds except Sharp&#146;s, it&#146;s intended to sit in 
&#147;portrait&#148; orientation on your desk, with its narrow front edge forwards - so 
it&#146;s confusing that the lid has a handle placed along one long edge. When we 
tried to lift the lid using this, it came half-way off in our hands; not a tragedy, 
as it&#146;s mean to be detachable, but clearly a problem, and the little &#147;lift here&#148; 
sticker on the front isn&#146;t enough to offset it.</p>
<p>The 9600 was the only unit this month that wouldn&#146;t function correctly on 
the testbed Carrera&#146;s Adaptec card. Although the Adaptec detected it 
correctly, Windows 95 thought there were eight units attached on the same 
SCSI ID, and the TWAIN driver hung the system at the prescan stage. 
Using the supplied 16-bit SCSI adaptor worked better, but this required a 
DOS driver in CONFIG.SYS. The installation program copied the driver to 
the root directory, quite separate from the control software, which is 
annoying. The card uses a single, auto-assigned I/O port, and no interrupt or 
DMA channels - it should be easy to get it working in any system, but you 
can&#146;t use it for any other SCSI devices. All the fiddling around getting it 
installed was made even more painful by the 2min 10sec power-on self-test 
the scanner runs, before which it won&#146;t respond - so we had to wait for this 
to finish each time before turning on the PC!</p>
<p>The supplied 16-bit TWAIN drivers wouldn&#146;t install correctly under 
Windows 95, but Trust&#146;s efficient technical support line offered to post us 
the right disk, and directed us to their bulletin board and <a href="http://www.trust.box.nl">Web page</a> as a 
quicker route. The newer drivers installed OK, and included a useful SCSI 
diagnostic, but they caused OmniPage Pro some initial confusion, resulting in 
unreadable white-on-black pages. The scanner comes with the older and 
more limited OmniPage Lite, which is still better than many OCR packages, 
and the same ImagePals 2 GO! software supplied with the 4800SP scanner 
- see that review for details.</p>
<p>Performance was poor - it&#146;s the slowest scanner on test, due partly to the 
sluggish calibration cycle before each scan, although the slow ISA SCSI 
card has some bearing too. Scan results ranged from indifferent to bad: the 
photo tests suffered from poor contrast, and the adjustments necessary to 
OmniPage Pro to get successful scans caused inferior OCR results.</p>
<p>Overall, we can&#146;t recommend this scanner. It&#146;s big, slow, and we had 
problems with its TWAIN and SCSI support.</p>
