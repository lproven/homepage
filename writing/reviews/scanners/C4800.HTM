<h1><font size=5>Primax Compact 4800</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: 01235-559922 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: An OEM version of the Mustek 600, this is a reasonable 
little unit at a bargain price. However, the bundled software isn&#146;t 
really worth having.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Primax Compact 4800, like the Trust Imagery 4800SP, is a remodelled 
version of the Mustek 600 scanner, and many of the same comments apply 
to this unit as to its two siblings. When attached to our Adaptec PCI SCSI 
adaptor, it even identified itself on the startup screen as an MFC600! 
Contrary to the comments in other magazine&#146;s reviews, it worked fine on the 
Carrera&#146;s AHA2940 adaptor - the only difficulty was in actually connecting 
it, as it has non-standard SCSI connectors. Rather than a pair of 25-way 
Amphenol connectors, it has one D25 connector (like a PC&#146;s parallel port) 
and one 50-way mini-SCSI 2. To connect it, we had to use a special 
mini-SCSI to D25 cable to attach it to the Adaptec, and a SCSI 2 
terminator, which are hard to come by. The scanner comes with a Mustek 
8-bit SCSI card and a D25-to-D25 cable, and the skimpy manual makes 
no mention of termination at all. As with all of the devices this month, we 
tested it with the Adaptec card, but it&#146;s a good job it worked, because 
installation program couldn&#146;t detect the supplied adaptor in the review 
machine.</p>
<p>The scanner comes with the same 16-bit TWAIN driver as the Trust and 
Mustek, but renamed to read &#147;Primax&#148;. This installed fine, although it&#146;s 
confusing that the installation program offers a choice of only the Trust card 
or an Adaptec 15xx-series one, as it worked fine with our different 
Adaptec; it looked as if it would actually work with any card with an ASPI 
driver. The driver worked perfectly with all the software we tried, although it 
was worrying that the bundled ReadIRIS OCR software identified it as an 
&#147;Handy&#148; scanner. ReadIRIS was very disappointing - an awkward 16-bit 
Windows application, it generated several spurious errors while scanning 
before displaying a rather twee icon of a computer with big eyes and hands 
shuffling paper. The resulting text file wasn&#146;t even opened - we had to locate 
it with Explorer and open in with Notepad, revealing very inaccurate 
recognition. If OCR is a priority, it would be better to pay the &#163;139 to 
upgrade to OmniPage Pro, which did rather better, although still not 
brilliantly.</p>
<p>The image editing software, FinishingTOUCH, is better, but still 
unimpressive; also 16-bit only, it compares badly to the shareware 
PaintShop Pro. The README file notes that it has no LZW compression 
support for copyright reasons, so it can&#146;t even handle GIFs or compressed 
TIFs.</p>
<p>Overall, the scanner&#146;s performance is middle-of-the road, and whilst it&#146;s 
cheaper than its siblings, you might have to budget for better software, and 
possibly a proper SCSI adaptor and cables.</p>
