<h1><font size=5>Epson GT-5000</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Small, fast, and easy, with good software, this is a good first 
flatbed - although you do pay extra for the Epson name. </font></h3>

<p>Epson are one of the biggest names in both printers and scanners, and their 
range of three models submitted here shows the breadth of their experience 
well. As there are many features in common across the trio, this and the 
following two reviews should be read as a set. </p>
<p>The 5000 is the baby of the range, but it compares well with more 
expensive offerings from other manufacturers. All three models have a 
bi-directional parallel port interface to allow connection to a PC without the 
use of a SCSI card. The two higher models both have SCSI as well, but 
there are two versions of the basic 5000, one with parallel and SCSI, and 
one with just parallel, which is what we looked at. The interface requires a 
bi-directional parallel port, which means it won&#146;t work with old, late-80s 
PCs with unidirectional parallel ports, but unfortunately it isn&#146;t entirely 
compatible with the new, faster Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) specification. 
This isn&#146;t unique, and so most modern PCs with EPP parallel ports have a 
BIOS setting to turn it into a bi-di or uni-di port, but to be sure it will work 
with anything, Epson include an adaptor card with a bi-di secondary (LPT2) 
parallel port on it. The scanner worked on our Carrera&#146;s EPP when this was 
set to bi-di mode, but having to include an adaptor rather obviates the 
benefits of cardless parallel connection. One snag is that, even though the 
PC came with Windows 95 build 950a preinstalled, it was still necessary to 
apply Microsoft&#146;s LPT.VXD patch to enable bi-di operation. Epson had 
warned us of this in advance, but the patch isn&#146;t installed by default, even 
though it&#146;s been on the Windows 95 CD ever since the initial launch.</p>
<p>Physically, the 5000 is compact, at around the same size as the Mustek 600 
and relatives. It&#146;s considerably smaller than the other two Epson models, 
and also lacks their facility to accept optional sheetfeeders and transparency 
adaptors. Still, its scanbed is the same size, although its optical and 
interpolated resolutions are lower, and it scans in 24-bit colour, compared 
to the others&#146; 30-bit process. This shows in the poorer quality of photo 
scans and colour matching, but has the benefit of faster operation, as there&#146;s 
less data to process.</p>
<p>The same software is supplied with all three scanners: the same TWAIN 
driver supports them all, automatically enabling the relevant features for each 
model, and the bundled applications are also shared.</p>
<p>Although it lacks the output quality and additional features of its biggest 
brothers, the Epson GT-5000 is a good, fast entry-level scanner, although it 
isn&#146;t up to serious professional use. Epson do need to tidy up the installation 
procedure for EPP-equipped Windows 95 PCs, though.</p>
