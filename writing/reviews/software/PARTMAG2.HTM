<p>Partitioning is part of the process of formatting a hard disk,
when the disk is divided up into separate volumes. In most PCs,
with only a single hard disk drive and one operating system, the
simplest and easiest way to partition the drive is to assign all
the space on it as one big volume, and this is what the
installation programs of DOS and Windows 95 automatically do -
but unfortunately, this is the most inefficient way. [See box]</p>

<p>Until PartitionMagic, partitioning was a once-and-for-all
process. The FDISK programs supplied with DOS, Windows 95 and
OS/2 only allows partitions to be created and removed - they
can't be moved or resized. To change the partitioning scheme of a
drive means backing up its contents, deleting and recreating the
partitions, then reinstalling the operating system and restoring
the backup - a long and tedious job. PartitionMagic allows
partitions to be moved and resized dynamically - in other words,
while they contain data.</p>

<p>The program itself is quite small and simple - it's just under
a megabyte in size, and can be run directly from the supplied
floppies without installing it at all. Although it's technically
a DOS program, it runs in full-screen graphics mode and has been
designed to look exactly like a Windows 95 application in every
detail. It can be operated with mouse or keyboard, and will run
in Windows 95's MS-DOS mode, but not under NT or OS/2, for which
a special version is available.</p>

<p><b><i>PartitionMagic's main screen - I can't believe it isn't
Windows!</i></b></p>

<p>The program's single screen resembles the graphical
partitioning utilities of OS/2 and NT: there are drive icons for
each physical hard drive in the machine, beneath which is a bar
which is split up into coloured boxes representing the partitions
on the currently selected drive. The program's functions can be
accessed from the menus, or just by clicking buttons beneath the
drive bar. There are straightforward options for creating,
checking and reporting the status of partitions; these give more
detailed information than the DOS FDISK and CHKDSK commands,
bring all the essential functions into one place, and are easier
to use. The interesting functions are behind two similar buttons
labelled Resize and Move.</p>

<p>The Move command does just what it says: a partition can be
moved around the disk just by dragging it with the mouse, or
typing values for the free space before or after it. This works
on any of the partition types that PartitionMagic understands:
DOS and Windows 95 FAT, OS/2 HPFS, Windows NT NTFS, Novell
Netware or Linux Ext2. </p>

<p>Only FAT and HPFS partitions can be resized, which is done two
ways. Clicking on the Resize button or menu option gives a
dialogue box containing a bar showing the selected partition and
its maximum and minimum possible sizes. The size can be altered
by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or by typing in the
desired size. If the size chosen crosses the boundary at which
the cluster size changes then the clusters will be automatically
resized. Alternatively, if the aim is to get smaller clusters,
there's a Cluster Resize option on the Advanced menu, which
allows you to choose the size of clusters desired and will resize
the partition appropriately. </p>

<p><b><i>The impossible made easy: resize a partition by dragging
the bar</i></b></p>

<p>If you've ever battled with DOS' FDISK and FORMAT commands
trying to set up a machine, or if you juggle Windows 95, NT and
OS/2 on one PC as I do, then this is a revelation. However, once
the point's been grasped, the question remains of how useful the
program is. </p>

<p>I tried it out on a machine with only 79Mb of free space left
on its 1.01Gb drive, although it only contained 755Mb of data.
Resizing the partition to 1020Mb allowed the use of 16Kb
clusters, and free space went up to 180Mb. The process was very
fast, taking less than a minute, which made it easy to experiment
with different sizes. Unfortunately, 16Kb clusters are still
pretty inefficient - 8Kb clusters would get roughly 50Mb more,
but would require dividing the disk into two sub-512Mb drives,
for example C: for software and D: for data files. I ran the
program on a wide variety of different PCs, and it never crashed
or lost a byte of data, although it refused to run on one machine
at all, claiming there was an error in the partition table. The
best way to use it is to boot the PC from a DOS floppy, and run
the program direct from the supplied floppy disk, as it can't
resize a disk containing open files - including the program
itself.</p>

<p>Soon, drives of greater than 2Gb will be common on desktop
PCs. This is the maximum size of a single FAT partition, so they
will have to be split into multiple drives before use. However,
this is already necessary to use more than 75% of the capacity of
a 1Gb drive. PartitionMagic is one of the packages that most
would use once, then never again, so it would be good to see it
combined with some general tools for checking and repairing hard
disk drives, but as it stands, it's the only way to properly
repartition a fully-installed PC, and if your computer has a
large hard drive, it will pay for itself almost immediately.</p>

<p><font size="4">Box: Partitioning for Windows 95 </font></p>

<p>Although Windows 95 fixes many of the problems of its
predecessors, it still uses the same 15-year-old disk format as
DOS, known as the FAT (File Allocation Table) filing system.
There are quite a few drawbacks to using FAT, one of the biggest
being its vulnerability to corruption, but the one that concerns
us here is its inefficiency.</p>

<p>When a disk is formatted with FAT, it's divided up into
multiple blocks of disk space called clusters, from which files
are allocated. Bigger disks just use bigger blocks, rather than
more of them, up to a maximum of 2Gb. Each time the cluster size
doubles, so does the maximum partition size - see the table
alongside.</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td><b>Disk size (Mb)</b> </td>
        <td><b>cluster size (Kb)</b> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 - 32 </td>
        <td>0.5 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;32 - 64 </td>
        <td>1 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;64 - 128 </td>
        <td>2 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;128 - 256 </td>
        <td>4 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;256 - 512 </td>
        <td>8 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;512 - 1,024 </td>
        <td>16 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;1,024 - 2,048 </td>
        <td>32 </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The cluster is the smallest unit of disk space that can be
allocated: all files on disk take up one or more clusters. This
means that even small files containing a few bytes occupy a whole
cluster - on a 1.08Gb drive, currently a common size, they take
32Kb - of which nearly all is wasted, empty space! If a file is
31½Kb long, it still takes up 32Kb, which is very efficient -
but if it grows to 32½Kb, it takes two clusters, occupying 64Kb
and wasting nearly half of that space. As files get larger,
proportionally less space is wasted - but typically, many files
will be under 64Kb; for example, the text in this box is about
14Kb long. It's easy to check on your own system: the DOS command
CHKDSK will tell you how much disk space is allocated in
clusters, and what size those clusters are. To get the total
amount, add the figures for hidden files, directories and user
files together. Typing DIR C:\ /S/A/W will list all the files on
your disk, and the last line gives the exact total number of
bytes they contain. The difference between these figures is the
wasted space on your disk. There are two ways to avoid the
problem: either upgrade to OS/2 or Windows NT, which both have
improved filing systems which can be used instead of FAT, or
split your drive up, keeping partitions smaller than a gigabyte,
and preferably under 512Mb for efficient 8Kb clusters.</p>
