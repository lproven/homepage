<p>The Psion Series 3 and 3a (or S3) are the most popular &quot;personal digital 
assistants&quot; in Britain and Europe, and sell well in the rest of the world, too. 
Since one of the advantages of keeping your personal information digitally is 
that, unlike the pages in a FiloFax&#153;, it can be readily backed-up, it's been a 
major snag for Psion that the connection kit for linking an S3 to a PC used a 
rather horrible command-line-driven DOS program called MCLink. Last 
year, Psion released an improved successor, RCom, but it was still a 
command-line driven DOS program, albeit with a helpful Windows installer.</p>
<p>Now, finally, here is what S3 users have been waiting for - an official 
Windows-based system for linking PC and S3. PsiWin comprises the 3Link 
cable and a suite of 16-bit Windows software: Psion Manager, the actual 
link application, Psion Database, a Windows version of the S3's built-in 
database, and Psion Print, which allows an S3 to print to a printer 
connected to the PC. Although the software is intended for Windows 3.1, it 
works fine with Windows 95 and NT.</p>
<p>The 3Link cable is unchanged - it simply converts the Psion's 
communications port to a standard RS232 port capable of up to 
19,200bits/sec, with both 9-pin and 25-pin &quot;D&quot; connectors, so it can also 
be used for connecting an S3 to a modem or serial printer. It also contains a 
ROM which provides basic communication software for Series 3 machines 
- this is built in to the 3a.</p>

<p>The Psion Manager looks and works very like the Windows for 
Workgroups file manager - it offers multiple windows showing the Psion's 
drives alongside the PC's. Files can be copied or moved between S3 and 
PC by simply dragging and dropping, and it will also convert Psion files from 
their proprietary formats into a range of standard PC ones - this works for 
all the built-in Psion applications. There's an option to backup all the files on 
the S3 to the PC in one go, too, which also has its own entry in the Program 
Manager or Start Menu. One drawback is that the Psion Manager attempts 
to connect to the S3 every time it's started, causing an annoying delay if the 
S3 isn't connected.</p>
<p>It is awkward to try to keep two separate sets of files in step if you use a 
PC-based contact manager, as you have to convert your files every time 
you take the Psion away from the PC. However, if you mainly use the Psion 
for this, then there is the Psion Database - essentially a version of the S3's 
built-in database application for Windows, it lets you use your Psion 
database files on your PC. Small and fast, I find it's all the contact manager I 
need - but it's a great shame there isn't a similar version of the Psion Agenda 
to go with it; Agenda files must be converted and then opened with a 
Windows PIM - and the only two directly supported are Lotus Organiser 
1.0 and Symantec ACT! 2.0. </p>
<p>It must be said that there has been a third-party equivalent for two years - 
Widget Software's WinLink, which lacks the database and printing 
functions, but can translate Psion OPL files. Widget also offer a Agenda 
Link, separate program for converting Agenda files, which WinLink can't do 
unaided - this has the advantage of being able to handle Microsoft 
Schedule+ 1.0 files as well as Organiser 1 and 2. However, the Psion 
product is more polished and integrated, and works out cheaper than 
WinLink and Agenda Link combined - especially as it comes with the Psion 
cable you need to buy to use the Widget software.</p>
