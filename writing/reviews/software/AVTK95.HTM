<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Although the Windows 95 version is still a little raw in 
places, this remains the definitive PC antivirus package. Essential 
for anyone who values their data, although like any antivirus 
software, it's best coupled with at least one other totally-different 
package to cover all the bases.</font></h3>

<hr>
<p>This is the new Windows 95-compatible version of S&amp;S' virus protection 
package. Along with simple scanners, which search a PC's drives for 
infection, the main other type of anti-virus package are resident &quot;guardians&quot; 
that attempt to protect the PC from infection by running in the background, 
checking disks and programs as they are used. Windows 95 has problems 
with these: the way that they monitor the PC's activity is by &quot;trapping&quot; the 
DOS disk-access call, allowing them to check all files for infection as they 
are read or written. This conflicts with Windows 95's 32-bit disk access 
routines, forcing Windows into &quot;MS-DOS compatibility mode&quot; and crippling 
its performance. For some people, protection from viruses is more 
important than performance and this is tolerable, but most would probably 
prefer to take a chance than slow their PCs down. This is compelling 
anti-virus application vendors to produce new versions that will work with 
95.</p>
<p>S&amp;S International are one of the first companies to come up with a proper 
Windows 95 anti-virus suite. As it complements the other Windows 
versions, for 3.x and NT, S&amp;S has chosen not to give it a new release 
number; it's flagged as version 7.54. The main changes are that all the 
Windows components are fully 32-bit, the suite now understands long 
filenames, and there's a new version of WinGuard rewritten as a Windows 
Virtual Device Driver (VXD), so that it doesn't force Windows into DOS 
Compatibility mode. There's no need for a simple utility like this to support 
advanced Windows 95 features such as OLE, but sadly it lacks other 95 
niceties such as drag and drop, and it can't be uninstalled from the Windows 
Control Panel.</p>
<p>The Windows version of the Toolkit has always included a copy of the 
DOS version - this doesn't waste much room because they use the same 
core database files. Although there a few Windows-specific ones, most PC 
viruses are DOS programs, which work at a very low level, close to the 
machine's hardware - such as the common Parity.b virus, which fakes faulty 
SIMMs. The best way of catching them is therefore a DOS program which 
can work at a similar level. The AVTK includes DOS utilities to search for 
and remove viruses from both files and disks, as well as a resident 
&quot;guardian&quot; which sits in the background. In the Windows 3 toolkit, the 
Windows scanner called this DOS program and wouldn't work without it, 
but the Windows 95 version is independent and will work without the DOS 
component, although it provides a valuable extra measure of protection 
while the system is booting-up - one of its most vulnerable times.</p>
<p><img src="images/toolkit.gif" align=bottom width=398 height=272></p>
<p><b><i>The Toolkit's main screen provides a simple way to check multiple 
drives in one go</i></b></p>
<p>There are several Windows components in the AVTK, including a scheduler 
and Virus Encyclopaedia. However, the main ones are the front-end to the 
scanner and the background monitor, WinGuard. As WinGuard is a VXD, 
it won't work under Windows NT, Windows 3 or OS/2 - it just pops up a 
message announcing that it only runs under 95. With this operating system, it 
sits on the task bar, quietly watching over your shoulder as you work. 
Unlike the Macintosh or Amiga, the PC has no way of checking when a 
floppy disk has been inserted, so WinGuard only springs into action when a 
diskette is first accessed. In testing, it found the AntiExe virus immediately 
and prevented further access to the disk. Its other function is to monitor 
programs as they are loading, and warn the user when a virus-infected file is 
run. The installation program tries to add WinGuard to the RUN= line in 
WIN.INI, which works fine under 95 but creates a Registry entry under 
NT, which took some time to find - for the curious, it's 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER:Software/Microsoft/Windows 
NT/CurrentVersion/Windows:run. With WinGuard active, programs take 
slightly longer to load as they are scanned, but general operation isn't 
measurably slower.</p>
<p>The other main Windows component is the scanner, FindVirus; it's regularly 
updated, and this latest version not only adds some new viruses to the list 
but also adds the ability to scan inside Microsoft Word files for the new 
macro viruses - a useful addition, but it has the serious drawback of causing 
FindVirus to crash if it tries to scan a Word file that was 
password-protected using Word's security option. S&amp;S are aware of the 
problem, though, and it should be fixed by the time you read this. At 
present, by default it only scans files with the extension .DOC or .DOT, so a 
file by a different name won't get scanned, but there is an option to scan all 
files, regardless of type or name.</p>
<p><img src="images/findviru.gif" align=bottom width=466 height=377></p>
<p><b><i>The scanner's warning could almost be designed not to alarm you</i></b></p>
<p>The program that carries the Toolkit name is a front-end to the virus scanner 
and repair utilities. Basically unchanged from the Windows 3 release, it 
allows you to check memory, local and network drives for infection, as well 
as removing viruses. It also has low-level editors for both binary files and 
physical disks, for the expert who is either fearless or truly desperate. 
Accessible either from here or its own Start menu entry is the Virus 
Encyclopaedia, which is a very basic reference to all the different strains that 
S&amp;S knows about; it doesn't cover the history of each virus, merely the 
essential technical details of what it does. Once you are sure your system is 
clean, clicking &quot;Check for changes&quot; runs ViVerify, which generates 
checksums for all of your executable program files; after this, ViVerify can 
watch out for any alterations to them, a common sign of infection. This 
allows the AVTK to detect viruses that aren't in its database, or that are 
self-modifying and therefore hard to detect. It might be better if the ViVerify 
program was run automatically to generate the checksums when the 
package was installed, as FindVirus is, and if checking for changes was 
integrated into FindVirus itself, but the current system is quite usable.</p>
<p><img src="images/encyclop.gif" align=bottom width=420 height=384></p>
<p><b><i>The Virus Encyclopaedia isn't verbose, but it tells you what you 
most need to know</i></b></p>
<p>The components of the Toolkit aren't quite as smoothly integrated with each 
other and the OS as they should be, but the AVTK's good at what it does 
and provides all the tools you need to keep your machine safe - or fix it 
when the disaster has already happened. This new Windows 95 release 
inherits a few of the Windows 3 version's minor irritations, but remains the 
best there is.</p>
