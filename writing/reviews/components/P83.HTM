<h1><font size=5>Intel 83MHz Pentium Overdrive</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>The heart of any computer is its processor, and whilst it's often not the main 
bottleneck preventing the machine from giving its best, replacing a PC's 
CPU with a faster one will make the whole system quicker. This, the latest 
in Intel's range of &quot;Overdrive&quot; CPU upgrades, is an 83MHz Pentium for 
33MHz 486 motherboards. It won't turn your old PC into a full-speed 
Pentium: there are a number of technical difficulties in replacing a 486 with a 
Pentium, the most awkward of which being that the Pentium has a 64-bit 
bus whereas the 486's is only 32 bits wide. This means that a special version 
of the Pentium, the P24T, had to be designed to fit onto a 486 
motherboard, and even then it requires a special socket. It runs internally at 
two-and-a-half times the clock speed, which means that it makes heavy 
demands of the machine's second-level cache. Whilst a 64K cache will do, 
128K is better and more is desirable; it will perform very badly in a machine 
with no secondary cache at all. Furthermore, for best results, it should be a 
write-back cache (which speeds memory writes as well as reads) as 
opposed to more common but slower write-through variety (which only 
caches reads.) This means that the full benefit of the upgrade will only apply 
to a modern, well-specified 486s, although lesser machines will still be 
accelerated. Finally, the Pentium has greater power and heat-dissipation 
requirements than a 486, which at the end of the day restricts the number of 
PCs in which this processor will really shine. Intel have a list of some 3,500 
systems it has tested and approved, but these are merely those in which it 
will work at all, not those for which it's best.</p>
<p>I tried the processor in four different machines, and it worked in all, but the 
speed gains varied widely. An IBM PC Server with a 486DX2/66 and 
256K of write-back cache increased markedly, whilst an AST Bravo 
466LC desktop, with only 64Kb of write-through cache, was less 
impressive. Older 33MHz machines did well too, but the older motherboard 
designs mean they can't quite catch up. Intel claim that a P24T is a better 
upgrade for an 8Mb DX2/66 than another 8Mb of RAM, and while this is 
true in that the speed increase is more than the RAM will give, 16Mb is a 
wiser upgrade - many programs run badly, if at all, in 8Mb of RAM, 
especially Windows 95, which really needs 16Mb. Overall, a 486/33 
machine should run about 60% faster, and a 66MHz PC will gain about 
30%, but it's not as fast as a &quot;full&quot; Pentium-83 would be - it's closer to a 
Pentium-60. If you already have a DX4/100 then it's definitely not worth it. 
The case for other machines is less clear-cut, but for Windows users, it's 
definitely worth upgrading to 16Mb first. If you have a power-user's 486 
machine from a couple of years ago, with a DX33 or DX2/66 plus a P24T 
socket, 16Mb of RAM, a VESA motherboard and graphics card, and 
enough hard-drive space, then it's a good deal; whilst the best alternative 
would be swapping the motherboard for a PCI-based Pentium one, this will 
mean you'll need a new graphics card and quite possibly new SIMMs too, 
and so will cost substantially more. </p>
