<h3><font size=3>P120/133 - If you have an elderly Pentium, this will give it a very 
gratifying boost, although not up to the level of a new P133. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>P125 - If you have a low-specification P75, then you should get 16Mb

<h2><font size=3>Intro</font></h2>
<p>The newest members of Intel's OverDrive range of upgrade processors are 
the first ones intended for Pentium-based computers, rather than 486s - the 
last of those, reviewed in PC Pro issue 14, transformed your 486 into a 
Pentium. At the moment, there are two models available in the new range, 
one for 75MHz computers and another for 60 or 66MHz units.</p>
<p>All current Pentium processors, from 75 to 166MHz, fit into the same 
socket and use 3.3 Volt power, so it's theoretically possible to upgrade a 
P75 PC with an ordinary Pentium chip. However, this has several snags: it 
requires adjusting motherboard jumpers, which not all boards can 
accommodate - even if you still have the documentation! Also, a cheap 
50Mhz motherboard may not be able to cope with being boosted to 
66Mhz, and finally, as higher-speed Pentiums are more sensitive to the 
voltage of their power supply, a 120 or 133 might just not function on a 
slower board. The OverDrive simplifies things to a simple chip-swap, which 
should work in any PC, and is backed-up by a warranty.</p>
<p>The 60/66MHz upgrade is more interesting, as these chips run at 5V, 
preventing replacement with any faster one - the Overdrive is the only way 
to go.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Pentium OverDrive 120/133MHz </font></h2>
<p>Until now, if you had one of the first Pentium PCs, which ran at 60 or 
66MHz, you couldn't upgrade, because these processors ran at 5V while all 
the faster chips run at 3.3V. Intel's newest OverDrive is intended for these 
machines: it's a 3.3V processor that fits into the older 5V socket. The 
OverDrive runs at twice the clock speed - 120MHz in a 60MHz machine, 
and 133MHz in a 66MHz box.</p>
<p>When the Pentium was first launched, it was the fastest Intel processor, and 
it became the CPU of choice for high-end machines, so a machine of this 
vintage will probably be quite well-specified: my own has 16Mb of RAM 
and 256Kb of write-back cache. However, they aren't a great deal quicker 
than a fast 486 and they look slow compared to modern Triton-based 90 or 
100MHz machines. Now, at last, there's something you can do about it.</p>
<p>The CPU is only one of many factors governing a machine's speed - other 
crucial bottlenecks are the amounts of main and cache RAM, disk speed 
and the graphics card. The upshot of this is that replacing a computer's 
processor with one twice as fast won't, alas, make the whole PC twice as 
fast. In this case, as all else stayed the same, a 23% improvement is pretty 
good going: my machine felt considerably quicker. Disk-intensive activities 
like booting up and opening programs aren't much better, but scrolling, 
window redrawing and full-window dragging happen a great deal more 
rapidly; it feels like a new PC. Still, the final results are only about 2/3 [that's 
two-thirds] as fast as a new P133; older Pentium chipsets like Mercury and 
Neptune means the motherboard bandwidth is much lower. Overall, though, 
it makes a very pleasant difference, and it's some &#163;150 cheaper than going 
to 32Mb of RAM.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Pentium OverDrive 125MHz </font></h2>
<p>After the 5V originals, the next slowest Pentium is the 75Mhz. This has two 
roles in life: firstly, as a comparatively low-power and low-heat-emission 
Pentium for notebooks, which usually aren't upgradeable since the CPU is 
soldered onto the motherboard. Secondly, it exists for marketing reasons: 
Intel needed a low-end Pentium after they dropped the 60/66Mhz model. 
Even when the P75 was first released, there were faster Pentiums, so most 
PCs based on a P75 will be low-end ones, built down to a price. Thus they 
will probably have many other low-performance components aside from the 
CPU. To give meaningful speed comparisons, we needed to test the chip on 
a single computer, so that the CPU's effects on the overall performance 
were isolated. To show the expected gains on range of differently-specified 
PCs, though, we varied the specification of a Triton-based Dell from a 
minimal 8Mb of RAM and no cache to its standard 16Mb and 256Kb of 
pipeline burst-mode SRAM cache. Each configuration was benchmarked 
with the original P75 and the 125MHz Overdrive.</p>
<p>Adding 256Kb of cache to a PC with none - often the case in ultra-cheap 
PCs - made about the same performance difference as the Overdrive, but 
for less than half the price. Adding 8Mb of RAM gave more improvement 
than the Overdrive, for slightly less. If you shopped around, you could add 
both of these for only a little more money than an Overdrive, with much 
better results. The Overdrive is only really worth its cost if you already have 
16MB of RAM and a cache - it will run half as fast if there's no cache.</p>
