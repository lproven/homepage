<hr>

<p>As one of the world&#146;s biggest PC manufacturers, it&#146;s
rather appropriate that Gateway sent us the biggest PC in this
months&#146; Labs. The Sovereign comes in a newly designed tower
case, with a fetching curved fascia. It also has a big keyboard;
Gateway&#146;s previous one was a 121-key monster, and the new
version has three Windows 95 keys added to it. Although most
keyboards now have these keys, you can get by without them; the
Start Menu key just simulates Ctrl-Esc, and the &quot;Context
Menu&quot; key is similarly Shift-F10.</p>

<p>Inside, the Sovereign is spacious and well laid-out. It has an
astonishing twelve drive bays, although filling them all would
probably overheat the machine and burn-out its power supply. Most
of these occupy the upper part of the case, leaving the
motherboard largely unobscured. This is an Intel Endeavour, which
follows the new AT-X layout: the CPU is high up on the left,
underneath the power supply fan. It&#146;s a minor shame that in
such a huge and highly-expandable case, this machine has a
comparatively modestly-expandable motherboard; the Endeavour only
has three ISA slots, and one of these is shared with a PCI slot
to boot. </p>

<p>Gateway mount the serial and parallel ports directly onto the
motherboard, too, which further reduces the internal spaghetti.
This machine is a pre-production sample; shipping units will have
pipeline burst cache as standard, and a larger - but slightly
slower - 2Gb hard disk. Also, rough edges like the US set-up in
Windows and out-of-date video drivers will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Sovereign comes with two expansion cards as standard: an
Ensoniq SoundScape, providing wavetable sound through beefy Altec
Lansing speakers, and a Matrox Millennium graphics adapter.
Gateway&#146;s Matrox cards use the slower 175MHz RAMDAC as
opposed to the full 220MHz version, which means that its cards
can&#146;t display their theoretical highest resolutions and
refresh rates, but this isn&#146;t much of a loss for most
people. Our unit had 4Mb of WRAM installed, but this is an
optional extra - the standard configuration is 2Mb. On the
software front, you get MS Office Pro and Encarta &#146;96. The
monitor is a pin-sharp 17in Trinitron with easy controls
concealed under a small panel.</p>

<p>Gateway skimps on the power supply unit; there&#146;s no power
output for the monitor, just a mains-in socket. Turning on this
machine involves one switch at the front of the PC, one on the
rear of the monitor, and another on the speakers, taking up three
mains sockets.</p>

<p>Like most of the larger PC companies, Gateway uses PS/2
keyboards and mice, unlike the smaller builders&#146; AT
keyboards and serial mice. PS/2 mice use IRQ12, which can be a
snag in modern interrupt-starved multimedia PCs. In this machine,
only one IRQ is free, so you&#146;ll have problems if you want to
add both a network card and SCSI adapter.</p>

<p>The Sovereign&#146;s performance comes some way down our list,
due mainly to its Western Digital hard disk, but all the faster
machines are close anyway - it&#146;s no slouch. Given its huge
expansion potential, and the useful bundled MS Office, it&#146;s
a good buy.</p>
