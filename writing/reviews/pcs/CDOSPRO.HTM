<hr>

<p>CDoS have clearly learned a lot since their last PC Pro Labs
entry; the components of this machine are far better integrated
than before. As before, the motherboard is an Intel - this time a
Marle, the new Triton HX-based baby-ATX model. The case is the
same, but with its internal layout modified to the ATX layout:
all the I/O ports are mounted directly onto the motherboard, and
the CPU is located under the PSU. There are several ATX machines
this month, but only Evesham manage the single-fan ideal; this
machine&#146;s PSU has a rearwards-facing fan, so the Pentium has
an &quot;active heatsink&quot;. It&#146;s still quiet, though.
Sadly, the PSU has no power-out for the monitor, and there are
two power switches, which is confusing.</p>

<p>ATX motherboards have several side-effects. PS/2 ports are one
- here, connecting to a substantial Keytronics Win95 keyboard and
an MS Mouse II. The internal layout is very clean: the only
cables are those to the drives, and as the connectors are at the
top right of the motherboard, they don&#146;t get in anything
else&#146;s way. The expansion slots are right up on the edge of
the motherboard, so there&#146;s nothing in the way to foul
longer cards, a major problem in some machines - such as
Evolution&#146;s system this month. The only lead that reaches
right across the machine is the CD audio connector, which is hard
to avoid - although West One have managed by using an extremely
long lead.</p>

<p>There are three expansion cards in the machine. The lowest in
the case is a SoundBlaster 32, which is essentially an AWE32
without the onboard memory or IDE connector. It sounds just as
good, is cheaper, and doesn&#146;t cause a potential conflict
with the motherboard EIDE channels. All the extra Creative Labs
utilities are installed, too. It drives a pair of excellent
Yamaha YST-M15 speakers. The other ISA card is a Supra 28.8 from
Diamond, a combined data/fax/voice modem, complete with
Supra&#146;s Windows 95 modem driver and the elegant Trio
communications suite. The only missing comms component was
Windows 95&#146;s dial-up networking. The only PCI card is a
Stealth 3D 2000 which drives a sharp Iiyama VisionMaster 15.</p>

<p>Overall, this machine impresses. It&#146;s well-built from
good parts and the software is set up expertly, including
often-missed details like an MPEG decoder and CDoS&#146; contact
details in the System control panel. There aren&#146;t any Triton
2 drivers, which may limit performance slightly - but it&#146;s
only just slower than the Cyrix pack. The price is keen, too.</p>
