<h1><font size=5>Compaq DeskPro 5133</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Compaq was the first company to &quot;clone&quot; the IBM PC, and it has been 
vying with IBM for the position of top PC manufacturer virtually ever since. 
Although in recent years it has successfully moved into the lower end of the 
market with their Presario line, most of its revenue still comes from 
corporate LAN workstations and this is the intended function of the 
DeskPro 5133.</p>
<p>This is a &quot;designer&quot; PC: it has highly-integrated motherboard, with onboard 
QVision graphics and PCI Ethernet, as well as an optional sound system 
based on the ESS ES688 AudioDrive chip, all without using any expansion 
slots; unusually, it has only one serial port, although there is a PS/2 mouse 
port. The case lifts off easily after undoing three thumbscrews to display an 
exceptionally neat interior: the left half of the case houses the motherboard, 
with readily-accessible horizontal expansion slots on a riser card. It's easy to 
get at the CPU socket and generous six SIMM slots anyway, but for more 
serious work, the whole motherboard slides out to the left like a drawer. All 
the drive cables etc. actually plug into the riser card, as does the 
motherboard, so this can be slid out without disconnnecting everything. 
Similarly, just undo two catches and the whole drive-cage pivots out to the 
front on a hinge, which makes access to the drives a joy - quite a contrast to 
the usual nightmare of skinned knuckles and frayed tempers. Overall, a field 
engineer's dream.</p>
<p>The motherboard itself is entirely Compaq-designed, as is its proprietary 
TriFlex/PCI chipset, versions of which are also used in their highly-regarded 
fileservers. Alas, TriFlex is not as fast as Triton - for instance, it only 
supports PIO Mode 2 hard disk transfers, rather than the faster modes 4 or 
even 3. Overall, the machine's performance is disappointing - it's a fast PC, 
but it's the slowest of the group on test. This machine was supplied with a 
pleasant 15&quot; Compaq monitor and a typically soft keyboard, but Compaq 
has quite a range to choose from.</p>
<p>However, its other characteristics may make this irrelevant to its target 
buyers, corporate IT Managers, who should be more impressed by its good 
support and backup, coupled with excellent remote manageability, either 
using Compaq's own system-management software or third-party utilities. It 
supports the industry-standard Desktop Management Interface (DMI), as 
well as its own &quot;Intelligent Manageability&quot;: the computer can reports its 
configuration, serial numbers etc. to software either on the machine itself or 
over the network, but it's also able to monitor its own operation; for 
example, it has an &quot;IntelliSafe&quot; hard disk which can give some 72 hours' 
notice if it is about to fail, either alerting the network manager or literally 
backing itself up to tape. According to the Gartner group and others, in a 
business environment the actual buying price of a computer represents only 
20% of the cost of ownership over a few years - the rest being such things 
as maintenance, software and hardware upgrades and training - and this is 
where this machine will really score.</p>
