<h1><font size=5>NEC PowerMate V133</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A neat and attractive machine, but we'd expect more from 
such a big name.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>NEC is a major player in the international computer market, and is one of 
the few manufacturers that make just about all the parts of a PC, right down 
to drives, chips, and monitors. Despite this, the test machine doesn't contain 
only NEC parts: the own-design motherboard is based around the Intel 
Triton FX chipset, with an Intel CPU and an integrated Alliance ProMotion 
graphics controller.</p>
<p>Although a new range, the neat, low-profile desktop case is similar to 
previous NEC models. The lid is held on by two thumbscrews to reveal a 
fairly clean interior. All the ports, including monitor and dual PS/2 
connectors, are mounted along the lower edge of the rear, but there's no 
power-out connector for the monitor. Expansion cards fit into a riser board, 
with one fairly inaccessible ISA slot on its back and a pair of ISA and PCI 
slot on the front, one pair sharing a backplane opening. Only two PCI slots, 
although less than many, isn't a handicap as there's no separate graphics 
card. Although there's nothing wrong with the layout, there's nothing 
especially good about it either. The chassis is screwed together, with no 
quick-release catches or clip-in drive rails as used by Digital or Compaq.</p>
<p>The software setup is neat, with a choice of Windows for Workgroups 3.11 
or Windows 95. The Windows 95 .CAB files are preloaded, a pleasing 
touch, but there are no device drivers supplied. These are pre-loaded into 
Windows, so when we fitted the NEC monitor and NEC four-disc 
autochanging CD-ROM, these were automatically recognised, but we had 
difficulties configuring our own copy of Windows for the benchmarks: the 
monitor, CD and - critically - the graphics chip were unsupported and so 
didn't give their best. Pre-loaded software includes unhelpful US-only 
versions of CompuServe, AOL and Prodigy, plus some pretty but shallow 
on-line manuals and guides.</p>
<p>Normally, the bare machine would be supplied for the dealer to configure. 
We asked NEC for a CD-ROM and a monitor, like the other suppliers, and 
they supplied a very desirable 4x4 CDR 251 and MultiSync XV15+, as 
mentioned above. However, the price given is just the total RRP of the 
components - individual resellers' configurations will vary, and a full system's 
street price would be much lower than this.</p>
<p>NEC targets its desktop PCs at corporate resellers, and doesn't really 
promote them itself. It seems that NEC doesn't feel any need to push the 
machines: although they support IT Manager-pleasing features such as DMI 
and self-monitoring hard drives, the complete absence of device driver disks 
or images, American preloaded software and unexceptional design is a 
letdown.</p>
