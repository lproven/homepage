<h1><font size=5>Evolution evPro100 T</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,645 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Evolution Computer Systems 0181 944 6222</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Fast and well-built from choice parts, this is a competent 
machine, but not quite the best deal going.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The EvPro is a good example of one of a typical PC from a smaller 
manufacturer. It's built up from a fairly standard collection of parts, 
assembled competently into a reasonable, if unexciting, computer.</p>
<p>Its minitower case contains an Asustek motherboard built around the now 
nearly-universal Triton chipset. The layout of the motherboard governs 
access to the internals of the machine, and Asus' design puts the SIMM 
sockets underneath the power supply, at the top rear of the machine in its 
normal position. It's fiddly, but they are accessible without removing 
anything, which is the most important consideration. To keep the ISA slots 
free from obstruction, the processor is shoved along into a position at the 
end of the PCI slots - we've never seen any full-length PCI cards yet, so it's 
as good as anywhere. One slot is shared between an ISA and a PCI 
connector, and the latter has an Asus MediaBus extension for ASUSTek's 
Media Card, a combined PCI video card and ISA sound card. We've 
never seen one of these, and it's unlikely to ever be used, but the slot takes 
normal PCI cards so it's no drawback. There's 256K of &quot;cache on a stick&quot; - 
in other words, on a removable board to make upgrading easy. The 
connectors for the motherboard I/O ports and drive cables are up near the 
SIMM sockets, so although that corner is crowded, they don't get in the 
way. The motherboard also has the ROM code to support an NCR53C810 
SCSI adaptor, which is optional extra PCI board. As most modern SCSI 
adaptors have their own on-board BIOS anyway, this seems rather 
superfluous.</p>
<p>Quantum ought to be a happy company; its Fireball hard disks are the hot 
choice (sorry) for almost all this month's machines. Evolution have chosen a 
1.2Gb model, which is fast but quite noisy. On its other EIDE channel the 
PC has an Aztech 6-speed CD-ROM drive, which makes a pleasant 
change from the more common quad-speed units. Not many applications 
need a 6-speed drive yet, but software installations whiz by. The other main 
components are big-name parts, too: a Diamond Stealth 64 Video VRAM 
card flings pixels around the screen at high speed in both DOS and 
Windows, and audio cards don't get any more compatible than a 
SoundBlaster 16. The sounds issue out through a pair of Zydec active 
speakers that look quite stylish, aside from their bright pink power switch. 
Their sound quality is acceptable if not great, and the maximum volume is 
ear-pummelingly loud.</p>
<p>The EvPro is quick, and only a hair's-breadth behind this months' four top 
performers. It's well-built from quality components, and while little sets it 
apart from most of this month's machines, it's a good buy.</p>
