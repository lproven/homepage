<h1><font size=5>Bits &amp; PC's Pentium Power V 100</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,496 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Bits &amp; PC's 01344 776050</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: An excellent deal for the money. The joint-quickest machine 
at a keen price, with some interesting extras.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Bits &amp; PC's isn't a very well-known PC builder, partly because, as it puts it 
itself, it has so much business from word-of-mouth that it doesn't need to 
advertise. Still, it's put together the joint-fastest PC in this month's labs. </p>
<p>The exterior of the minitower belies its performance: it's quite plain, with a 
very basic badge and an Intel Inside sticker. We had to save and quit 
Windows before trying the buttons on the front: the little ideograms above 
them were meaningless to us. One is a reset button, and the other appears 
to do nothing - presumably it's a turbo button. Next along is a keyboard 
lock, but since this doesn't hold the case shut or disable the mouse, it's not 
much use. The only interesting thing that can be seen from the outside is the 
Pioneer badge on the CD-ROM drive: this is a quality component, a fast 
4.4x speed drive that did well in our issue 14 lab tests.</p>
<p>Inside, the layout of the Super PC55CM motherboard isn't as neat as, say, 
the ASUSTek machines. The SIMM sockets are behind the 3.5&quot; drive 
bays, an awkward spot, and the CPU voltage regulator with its bulky 
heatsink would block full-length ISA cards, although the CPU socket is at 
the end of the PCI slots. If the hard disk had been placed in the vacant bay 
on top of the PSU, it wouldn't be quite as bad, although the floppy drive 
would still be partly in the way. A noteworthy point is that the IDE 
connectors are between the PCI and IDE groups of slots, so unlike most of 
the rest of the machines this month, no slots are shared between the two 
buses. All the other connectors are up underneath the PSU, out of anything's 
way.</p>
<p>In those slots are a couple of slightly more unusual components. One PCI 
slot is taken by a VideoLogic GrafixStar 400, which is optimised for video 
playback and can take daughterboards offering functions such as hardware 
MPEG decompression. It has a somewhat stingy 1Mb of DRAM onboard, 
and can only take another megabyte on top of that - but AVI playback was 
very smooth and looked good. Below the vanilla SoundBlaster 16 is a Pace 
MicroLin fx32+ 14.4Kbit/s modem, a good British choice, although as it 
lacks unusual features such as voice handling, a 28.8 unit would have been 
preferable by today's standards. One of the least interesting features of any 
PC is usually its floppy drive, but not this machine: it has a quad-density 
2.8Mb drive. Sadly, although they've been around for several years, 2.8Mb 
floppies never caught on; nothing comes on 2.8Mb media and blank disks 
are very expensive, so this is a pointless feature. The hard drive is another 
Quantum 1.2Gb Fireball - noisy but very quick. All this is operated via a 
typically-stiff Cherry keyboard and a Microsoft Mouse 2, and the results 
are conveyed via a sharp ADI monitor and a reasonable pair of Zydec 
speakers.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a solid machine. The parts are all good to excellent, although 
there are some pointless additions, but the parts sum up to a very fast 
whole.</p>
