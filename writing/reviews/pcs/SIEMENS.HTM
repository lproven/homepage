<h1><font size="5">Siemens-Nixdorf Scenic Pro C5/166</font></h1>

<hr>

<h3><font size="3">Price: £<b><i>way</i></b> too much</font></h3>

<h3><font size="3">Build quality: 1/3</font></h3>

<h3><font size="3">Verdict: A company of SNI&#146;s experience
should be able to do far better than this. Tragic. Avoid at all
costs.</font></h3>

<hr>

<p>Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme, or SNI, are one of
Europe&#146;s largest computer manufacturers, selling systems
from cash registers to minicomputers. It&#146;s to be expected,
then, that their machine will be different from the
run-of-the-mill clones, and that it will cost rather more - but
we weren&#146;t prepared for this.</p>

<p>The first impression of this PC was formed as we took it out
of its box. It&#146;s <i>heavy</i> - especially for a low-profile
desktop. The whole chassis is formed from 1mm sheet steel, making
it robust and recyclable, but absurdly heavy. Inside is an
SNI-designed motherboard, based around the Triton HX chipset and
an Intel Pentium. The design, though, is horrendous. The
expansion slots are on a riser card, but although this is roughly
in the middle of the machine, only one side has slots - wasting
the space on the rear, which is obstructed only by a few cables.
On the &quot;front&quot; of the riser are four slots - two PCI
and only a single shared ISA/PCI, right at the bottom - where
it&#146;s fouled by the CPU, voltage regulator, CELP module, and
an odd free-standing fan. Only a sub-half-length card would fit.
Conversely, the three PCI slots are full-length, despite the
scarcity of long PCI cards - and who needs three of them, with
on-board graphics and sound? Upgrading the graphics might be
popular, as they&#146;re based on an unimpressive Cirrus Logic
chipset, accompanied by a SoundBlaster-compatible Vibra16 chip.
The sound in and out sockets are handily located on the front
panel, but unfortunately the connectors are on the
diametrically-opposite corner of the motherboard - so a flylead
runs right across the case. The mouse and keyboard connectors
really should be here, too.</p>

<p>The riser card is secured by a heavy steel bridge that runs
across the centre of the machine. The rear part of this carries
the hard disk, which is fair enough - but the front is unused.
Considering that the PC has no free drive bays, it&#146;s insane
not to put a bay in the front of the bridge as well.</p>

<p>The machine&#146;s performance was poor. Along with the next
two slowest systems, from Dell and IBM, it shares a Western
Digital hard disk, but SNI has chosen the slower 1.2Gb model
rather than the American companies&#146; 1.6Gb. A 6X Mitsumi
FX600S CD rounds out the storage. On the software front, there
are no Triton 2 drivers, but there&#146;s a range of preloaded
software, including various helpful little utilities, wallpapers
etc, and MS Word and Excel, rather than the full Office suite.</p>

<p>SNI has clearly put some effort into this machine&#146;s
design, but it has learned nothing from the the competition. The
machine is badly designed and ridiculously overpriced.</p>
