<h1><font size=5>Atlantic Premiere Pentium/133</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Electrowide 01792-792999 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Very basic, but its flaws are minor. Ask for a better graphics 
card and monitor, though.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Atlantic has submitted quite a few machines to PC Pro in the past, and it's 
good to see that it's taken some of our previous comments to heart. Several 
faults present in its machine in our issue 18 Labs (Pentium 100s, April '96) 
have been corrected: the heatsink and speaker are securely clipped in place, 
for instance. The case has a new fascia, with &quot;Atlantic&quot; moulded across the 
bottom in inch-high letters. Less attractive is the logo next to the floppy 
drive; the company's three-colour wave symbol turns into an unrecognisable 
blob when moulded into the plastic.</p>
<p>The internal layout is plain, but clean. Another lesson learnt is shown by the 
neatly tied and folded cables, and IO ports fitted properly into the case 
cutouts, so you don't lose any slots. The slots are, however, covered by 
welded-in plates, a nasty touch. Still, with a modern integrated 
motherboard, there's no reason why the inside should be anything less than 
neat: there's only one expansion card in the machine, a rather sluggish 
no-name Cirrus Logic-based video card, which is the main let-down. Other 
components are respectable - a Western Digital hard disk and a Mitsumi 
CD-ROM. The motherboard is Triton HX-based, but the full benefits won't 
be felt because Atlantic hasn't installed the relevant drivers for the chipset. 
Also, there are no specific display drivers, just Windows 95's default Cirrus 
Logic one.</p>
<p>The lack of customisation to the Windows setup is odd, as Atlantic has 
customised the System control panel to show their company logo and 
support details. It's a pity their logo is too big to fit - it looks faintly 
ridiculous with the bottom two-thirds of the company name cut off. Another 
useful feature is the provision of real-mode CD-ROM drivers.</p>
<p>Outside, things are a bit less appealing. The system doesn't look bad, and is 
distinctive, with a blue power button and its name writ large upon the front. 
The keyboard is a very lightweight Mitsumi Windows 95 model, but we've 
seen worse. The mouse is rather lightweight too, and feels cheap; the 
Atlantic logo on its back doesn't help. The monitor is a very basic Samtron 
14in one, which can't display non-interlaced 1024x768 - not a good sign, 
even though this is unreadably small on a 14in display anyway.</p>
<p>Atlantic is improving: it has fixed a number of the problems present in earlier 
machines, and overall this isn't a bad PC. It's cheap and basic, and a 
number of the minor rough edges could be fixed by the user after purchase.</p>
