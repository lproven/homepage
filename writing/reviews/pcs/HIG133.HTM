<h1><font size=5>Hi-Grade Winputer P133</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,595 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A competent but undistinguished machine, let down mainly 
by its motherboard</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The computer business changes more quickly than just about any other on 
the planet, and it's remarkable how fast a well-specified machine becomes 
merely average. Hi-Grade's WinPuter P133 has a good specification, but its 
motherboard is based around Intel's 430FX chipset, the &quot;Triton 1&quot;. There's 
nothing wrong with that, but already, the Triton HX and VX are becoming 
the chipsets of choice for high-performance machines, and anything else is 
starting to look a little outdated. The motherboard has 256K of pipeline 
burst-mode cache surface-mounted onto it, and there's no CELP socket, so 
it's not upgradable, making the board less than ideal for a faster CPU. Also, 
the positioning of the CPU and voltage regulator blocks full-length card in 
most of the expansion slots. The hard disk is a 2Gb Seagate ST32140A, a 
good performer with a respectable capacity - but it's wastefully partitioned 
as a single 1.96Gb volume, when a pair of 0.99Gb partitions would hold 
some 300Mb more data.</p>
<p>The other devices are more respectable, though: an Hitachi CDR-7930 8X 
speed CD ROM, which tears through CD installations at an impressive rate 
of knots, and a Hercules Dynamite 128 graphics card, based on the new 
Tseng ET6000 controller chip. Hercules' drivers aren't quite as fast as 
VideoLogic's drivers for the GrafixStar 600, which is based on the same 
chip, and unusually, they don't modify the standard Win95 Display 
Properties control panel at all - the special Hercules controls are all 
accessed via an icon in the system tray. The card drives a very pleasing 
Iiyama VisonMaster 17 monitor - it's a good screen, although this drives the 
system's price up considerably compared to those with 15in monitors.</p>
<p>Data gets into the machine via a Cherry keyboard, but for once, this isn't 
partnered with a Microsoft mouse. Presumably, someone at Hi-Grade has 
been paying special attention to the reviews in PC Pro, because this 
computer comes with a left-handed mouse. The Microsoft device, despite 
its designers' denials, is really intended for right-handers, and feels odd in the 
left hand. This mouse, stamped with &quot;HI-GRADE&quot; across the top, is 
virtually a mirror-image of the MS shape, which pleased the single southpaw 
member of the Labs team immensely. All the same, it's certainly usable by 
right-handers.</p>
<p>There's no bundled software with this machine: it has the pre-Service Pack 
Windows 95 4.00.950 (rather than 950a) and nothing else aside from the 
video drivers. It's a decent and pretty fast machine, but limited by its 
motherboard, and Hi-Grade needs to improve the range and configuration 
of its pre-installed software. </p>
