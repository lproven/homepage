<h1><font size=5>Digital Venturis FX 5133</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict:	An excellent design, flawed only by its low-performance 
chipset</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>As befits one of the biggest names in the computer business, Digital's 
Celebris PCs are amongst the most desirable machines we've seen. The 
Venturis is its more basic range, but it still exhibits Digital's highly-integrated 
design, especially the own-brand motherboard, which has several clever 
features. There's no CPU fan - instead, the airflow from one in the front 
panel is ducted over the CPU. There are 6 SIMM sockets - two more than 
usual - and these have easy-to-use ribbed plastic grips instead of sharp 
metal tabs. There's an S3 Trio64V+ graphics controller with a megabyte of 
DRAM and sockets for another megabyte's expansion. Also mounted 
directly on the motherboard are parallel, monitor and dual PS/2 and serial 
ports, so there are few internal cables.</p>
<p>The one typical feature absent from this motherboard is a bank of expansion 
slots: these are mounted on a riser card along with the power and drive 
cables, which allows the whole motherboard to slide out of the case like a 
drawer, leaving any cards in situ.</p>
<p>So far, it's wonderful - there must be catch, and there is. It's the chipset. 
While the rest of the PC industry is moving to the Triton HX and VX 
PCIsets, Digital's chosen an SIS one, which in PC Pro's tests is consistently 
some 10-15% slower than the older Triton FX. Presumably, this is to 
differentiate the Venturis range from the higher-end Celebris, but it would be 
better advised to use Triton HX and VX for this purpose. Hard disk and 
CD-ROM drives are from Quantum and Toshiba, which is beyond 
reproach; there's even a special SIS driver for the EIDE controller, which 
helps to lift the PC's performance above several Triton machines in testing.</p>
<p>Outside the clean-looking white case, there's a reset button, which is safely 
small and recessed, a pleasantly symmetrical Logitech mouse, and clearly 
labelled ports at the back. About the only niggle is the absence of a power 
pass-through port for the monitor. Keyboard and monitor are both Digital's 
own: the former, although lightweight, feels pleasant; the latter, an 
acceptable 15in device, struggles to display 1024x768 at only 60Hz, but at 
800x600 it's crisp and steady. Last but not least, there's a range of bundled 
software, including diagnostics, system management tools, Netscape 1.22, 
and comprehensive online manuals in Adobe Acrobat format. </p>
<p>Chipset aside, there's really nothing but trivia to criticise about this system; 
the company's expertise shines through. Most of the details are perfect, and 
for business use, the manageability and build quality should outweigh the 
relatively modest speed.</p>
