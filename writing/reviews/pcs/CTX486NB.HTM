<h1><font size=5>CTX EzBook 486/100</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>A CD-less 486, the EzBook is one of the more basic machines in this 
month's line-up, but it's adequate for most purposes. It resembles some of 
the early Apple Powerbooks: the keyboard is right up against the screen 
hinge, leaving a generous wrist-rest in front, which contains a large central 
trackball. Touch-pads have become very fashionable for notebooks today, 
but several of the PC Pro labs team feel that the good old trackball is far 
easier. The overall effect is attractively elegant and restrained.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the CTX also shows a clean and simple approach to notebook 
design. There's no CD-ROM drive, but the machine does have integrated 
sound via the ESS688 chip. It has a single, tiny and tinny speaker built-in, 
along with a condenser microphone - oddly, there's a concealed switch 
underneath the machine which must be moved to use an external mic. Also 
underneath are the removable hard disk and the battery, which is tricky to 
remove; one of the first generation of &quot;smart&quot; batteries, it has a row of LEDs 
on the cell itself to show its level of charge. The various status indicators 
appear in a small LCD bar between the screen hinges - usefully, this is still 
visible when the machine is closed, showing that some thought went into the 
case design. A minor but common failing is that two catches are used to 
open the lid, making it tricky to open if you don't have full use of both hands. 
The keyboard layout is good, and avoids a problem to which most of the 
other notebooks in this labs fall prey - the Ctrl key is at bottom left, rather 
than some proprietary Fn key that's seldom needed. Far too many 
notebook keyboards appear to have been designed by people who have 
never used a Windows PC...</p>
<p>Around the back are the single serial port, an enhanced parallel port, sound 
jacks and a separate connector for the docking station. But wait - no 
keyboard or monitor port? Reading the rather unhelpful (and poorly 
translated into English) manual revealed that the machine has a special 9-pin 
mini-DIN port on the left hand side, into which you must fit a special 
Y-shaped cable which carries standard VGA and PS/2 ports. Odd, and too 
easy to lose or forget. This special port is located next to the PC Card slots, 
which usefully are one type II and a separate type III instead of the usual 
combination of the two. We also had to look in the manual to discover how 
to switch between the TFT screen and an external monitor - there's nothing 
on the keyboard to tell you, because the &quot;hotkey&quot; is set in the computer's 
CMOS and therefore may vary. In any event, as the hotkeys are 
BIOS-controlled, they don't work under Windows 95 - you have to quit to 
MS-DOS mode to use them. This is doubly odd as there are labeled 
controls for screen brightness and contrast using the Fn key. Perhaps there 
is some installable software to provide the same functionality under 
Windows, but it's hard for us to say, because the machine came completely 
blank - we had to partition the hard disk and install Windows ourselves. 
One would hope customers' machines were checked before despatch.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Verdict</font></h2>
<p>A neat little machine, without bulky power-sapping components such as a 
Pentium processor and CD-ROM drive, but it's a shame about the port 
layout. Given 16Mb of RAM, it should be more than fast enough for general 
use and should last rather longer away from the mains than more high-end 
equivalents.</p>
