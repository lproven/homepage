<h1><font size="5">CDoS Media Executive</font></h1>

<hr>

<h3><font size="3">Supplier: CDoS 01645 464450</font></h3>

<h3><font size="3">Price: £2,799</font></h3>

<h3><font size="3">Verdict: A very well-specified system, with
good components, but deeply flawed by an inexperienced set-up.</font></h3>

<hr>

<p>Among the usual components that we would expect to see in a
machine of this class, the CDoS has an interesting specification:
a 28.8Kbit/s modem, tape streamer, and <i>two </i>sound cards.</p>

<p>It was odd to see two SoundBlasters listed in Windows
95&#146;s device list. We tried removing one or the other, but it
kept reappearing at the next reboot. Opening the case showed why:
there <i>are</i> two of them. One&#146;s a Creative Labs Vibra 16
built into the Intel Endeavour motherboard, and the other&#146;s
an AWE32 in an ISA slot. The Vibra 16 was disabled, both in the
BIOS and in Windows&#146; device list, but it was still causing a
conflict, although the AWE32 was working. Furthermore, the
AWE32&#146;s IDE CD-ROM interface was enabled, even though the
machine&#146;s quad-speed Pioneer drive was connected to the
motherboard&#146;s secondary EIDE channel, causing another
resource conflict. The simplest way of dealing with this was to
remove the AWE32; this resolved all these problems, but at the
cost of wavetable sound. If the customer requests a particular
sound card, CDoS would be better advised to use the
sound-chipless version of the Endeavour motherboard. Whichever
card, the speakers are Juster units, and are among the best on
test.</p>

<p>Other devices are generally good: there&#146;s a 4Mb Matrox
Millennium, unfortunately with outdated drivers and the redundant
duplicate display card in Windows&#146; device list, driving an
Iiyama monitor. The CD-ROM and sound card have DOS device drivers
installed as well as Windows ones, which is useful when you want
to run software from DOS, and all the extra AWE32 Windows
utilities are loaded too. A unique inclusion is a Microsoft
Natural keyboard, complete with Intellitype software. These
keyboards are great for touch typists and a complete pain for
most other people - try before you buy!</p>

<p>We didn&#146;t try the tape streamer, as there were no tapes
supplied and the installed software was the Windows 3 version of
Colorado Backup. <i>(The Windows 95 version is part of the PC Pro
Essentials collection on the cover CD.)</i> You can kiss all your
long filenames goodbye if you restore your backup with this
version, and it might even stop the system from working properly
- a serious oversight. However, with the right software it&#146;s
a superb idea - every PC user should have some backup device;
floppies aren&#146;t a viable way of backing-up modern
gigabyte-plus PCs. On to the Pace internal V.34 modem: it&#146;s
set up with the correct Windows 95 driver, but on interrupt 4 -
the same as COM1, which a little sticker on the back of the case
helpfully tells you to is the mouse connector. With this
configuration, if you move the mouse, you&#146;ll lose the modem
connection.</p>

<p>CDoS has tried very hard with this system, but its
inexperience shows. Some of these faults could be oversights, but
not all. We expect greater expertise than this, but CDoS show
considerable potential.</p>
