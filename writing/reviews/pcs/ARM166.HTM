<hr>

<p>Armari isn&#146;t the cheapest of the smaller British PC
builders, preferring to go for quality rather than price - and
this machine exemplifies that ethos perfectly. It uses the same
case design as Panrix and Bits &amp; PCs this month, but Armari
uses the older Baby-AT layout rather than Panrix&#146; ATX board.
ATX-based PCs tend to be neater and cleaner internally, as this
arrangement needs fewer cables, fans and so on, but Armari&#146;s
Tyan Tomcat 1 motherboard is just about the best-designed Baby-AT
board around, and the machine is very tidy. The machine shares
several components with West One&#146;s, who chose an indentical
motherboard, Cyrix 6x86 CPU and hard disk.</p>

<p>The Triton HX chipset doesn&#146;t support multiple Cyrix
CPUs, so Armari uses the single-processor version of the Tyan
motherboard. It supplies Intel&#146;s device drivers for the
system and EIDE controllers, as well as Tyan&#146;s own
bus-mastering EIDE drivers. Armari also claims that there is a
bug in the latest stepping of the Intel PIIX3 chip which can
cause data corruption on large partitioned drives, and has
written and installed its own patch to correct this. As usual,
Armari has also installed its exceptional collection of drivers
and updates, as well as the new addition of comprehensive
technical documentation. All the optional components such as MPEG
decoders and soundcard drivers are present too, plus a
preinstalled copy of MS Works 4.</p>

<p>All the system&#146;s I/O ports are installed in case cutouts,
as the Tyan&#146;s nine expansion slots need every backplane
opening in the case, but it&#146;s a pity that these don&#146;t
include a PS/2 mouse port; instead, a serial MS Mouse II is
supplied, along with a beefy Keytronics keyboard. Sound is
courtesy of a full SoundBlaster AWE32, complete with IDE
controller, but this has been set to IRQ 12 to avoid conflict
with the onboard EIDE channels. This drives a pair of Yamaha
YST-M20DSP speakers; these resemble West One&#146;s M15s, with
the addition of &quot;Digital Surround Processing&quot;, which
adds extra depth to their already-impressive sound. Graphics are
generated by a Matrox Mystique, which isn&#146;t quite as fast as
West One&#146;s Lightspeed 128 but adds 3D acceleration with full
Win95 DirectX support. The results are crisply displayed by an
Iiyama VisionMaster 15. Storage is on a nicely-partitioned
Quantum Fireball 1280, loaded from a TEAC CD-58E, both solid
choices.</p>

<p>This is a beautifully assembled and configured machine.
Although several other companies have hardware of equivalent
quality, none can match Armari&#146;s expertise in software
configuration and setup, and the system performs excellently,
too. It&#146;s well worth the modest extra cost.</p>
