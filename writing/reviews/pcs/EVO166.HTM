<h1><font size=5>Evolution ev-C166 X-file</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;2,385 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: 0181-944-6222</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Build quality: 1/3</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: An ambitious system: top componentry contrasts with poor 
assembly and setup.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Evolution is clearly going for the high-end corporate market with this system, 
which has a formidable specification - but it's far from the high-end 
home/multimedia system we specified. The PC's most unusual characteristic 
is its excellent high-performance all-SCSI storage subsystem. The SCSI 
controller is a top-flight fast wide SCSI 2 DPT SmartCache 2144. Unlike 
the dearer Adaptec 2940W, this has an optional on-board hardware disk 
cache; Evolution supplied us one of these with 16MB of RAM installed, 
which would add &#163;368 to the system cost. In testing, we found that startup 
and shutdown were faster, but it gave only about 1% better benchmark 
performance, so the system was evaluated without it. Such a controller is 
really better suited to highly disk-intensive systems such as fileservers; we 
saw a bigger improvement with an extra 16Mb of main memory, at less than 
half the price.</p>
<p>On the DPT's narrow channel is a nippy 6.7x Toshiba CD-ROM, whilst on 
the wide channel is a fast wide IBM UltraStar XP2 4.2Gb hard drive. This 
is an excellent, fast drive, but to use it with Windows 95 it must be 
partitioned up into at least 3 parts, as 95 currently can't handle partitions 
bigger than 2Gb. Evolution's engineer had created the first partition, but left 
the rest of the disk unused, which is sloppy.</p>
<p>Internally, the machine is cluttered. The motherboard is a baby-AT 
ASUStek Triton FX, still serviceable but starting to look out-of-date. Two 
of its three ISA slots are taken by the SoundBlaster AWE32 and US 
Robotics modem, with all their software properly installed and the modem 
set to IRQ5, which is good to see. However, the position of the CPU forces 
the full-length SCSI controller into the shared ISA/PCI slot, so there are no 
free ISA slots. This also leaves four cables stretching right across the case, 
which is awkward. Although we like to see PS/2 mice, the port is mounted 
in an expansion slot along with the two serial ports - whilst ten case cutouts 
remain unused! No slots are blocked, but it's untidy.</p>
<p>The software setup also lacks polish. The machine's IDE controllers are still 
enabled, though they're redundant on an all-SCSI system. The machine 
thinks it has four serial ports, probably because the modem is configured as 
COM4 instead of COM3. The version of Windows supplied is the 
pre-service-pack build 950, with no power-management enabled. DPT's 
Storage Manager was supplied but not installed, because it's the 16-bit 
version which won't run under 95.</p>
<p>On the outside is an agreeable Fujitsu keyboard, an MS Mouse 2, and a 
commendable CTX 15in monitor with crisp inbuilt speakers. The display is 
generated by a Matrox Millennium, complete with up-to-date v3.11 drivers.</p>
<p>Evolution has clearly tried hard with this machine, but it's aimed rather too 
high, and the build quality falls below what we expect.&#160;</p>
