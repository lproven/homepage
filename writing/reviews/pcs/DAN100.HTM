<h1><font size=5>dan Home PC/100</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,512 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: dan technology 0181-830-1100</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A reasonable package with some useful software, but 
there's a price premium for dan's name and support</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>dan Technology is one of Britain's best-known independent PC builders, 
and has a good reputation for solid, reliable machines and support. The 
machine supplied this month is from its Home PC range, but has been 
slightly upgraded from the standard configuration to meet our specifications: 
it has a 1Gb hard drive rather than a half-gig unit, a 15&quot; monitor instead of 
14&quot;, and no modem.</p>
<p>It's housed in one of the more attractive desktop cases this month, with a 
pleasingly curved fascia bearing a non-functional turbo button and a rather 
more helpful reset one, which is flush with the case to protect it from 
accidental operation. Inside, the layout is neat. The machine has the same 
characteristic brown ASUSTek motherboard as the Evolution, and the same 
comments apply to this machine. All the drive cables are neatly folded and 
held by cable ties, and there's a clip on top of the PSU top keep the 
CD-ROM cable out of harm's way. One small niggle is that the hard disk 
has been mounted in one of the front-panel drive bays, leaving an internal 
bay atop the PSU empty. For a standalone machine with a gigabyte of 
storage, a tape backup drive is really essential unless you don't value your 
data at all, and you'd have to move the hard disk to fit one into the 3.5&quot; 
drive bay. Otherwise, the inside is flawless, including the professional touch 
of serial and parallel connectors mounted in the cutouts on the rear of the 
case, rather than on an blanking plate, which wastes an expansion slot.</p>
<p>dan has selected the same Chuntex monitor as Amstrad and Evolution, but 
like most manufacturers, it hasn't installed the DOS refresh-rate setting utility 
in the machine's AUTOEXEC.BAT file, so the Chuntex wasn't giving its 
best. It's still early days for Windows 95 display drivers; Microsoft's built-in 
ones have no way of setting the screen refresh rate, and most third-party 
efforts, such as the Matrox ones that dan thoughtfully supplies on floppy 
disk, don't include this - you have to find it and install it yourself, or stare at 
a low-refresh screen. dan does take care to pre-install Windows properly, 
including a customised display scheme and desktop. Bundled software 
includes the F-Prot antivirus scanner, a good idea as Windows 95 lacks any 
integral virus protection. There's also the rather useless dan Information 
Utility, which tells you about the bundled software and dan's contact details; 
Lotus Organizer, the very latest version 2.1; MS Works 4 and some CD 
leisure titles.</p>
<p>Other hardware includes a SoundBlaster 16 coupled to a pair of small 
active speakers. These are acceptable, but the sound isn't as good as the 
Yamaha, Juster or even Zydec ones, lacking bass and high-end volume. 
There's a Microsoft Mouse 2, love it or loathe it, and a slightly stiff Cherry 
keyboard, but these are largely a matter of personal taste.</p>
<p>The dan is pretty fast, but its 1Gb Quantum Fireball isn't as fast as the 
1.2Gb units used in the top five performers. It's a polished machine which 
should give no cause for complaint, but just misses this month's best buy.</p>
