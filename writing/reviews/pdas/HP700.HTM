<h1><font size=5>Hewlett-Packard OmniGo 700LX</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: An HP200 with added wireless communciations, which seem 
impressive - until you see Nokia's version. </font></h3>

<hr>
<p>The OmniGo 700LX is a strange beast. At heart, it's that same machine as 
the HP 200LX, but modified to accommodate a Nokia 2110 cellphone, 
giving it mobile communications capabilities comparable to Nokia's own 
Communicator 9000. As such, most of the same comments from the 200LX 
review apply equally to the 700LX - but despite its sharing the OmniGo 
name, it has little in common with the OmniGo 100. The 200LX and 700LX 
have the same screen, keyboard, processor, memory and built-in software. 
The additions to the 700 are a larger case with a docking station for the 
phone on the back of the screen. Although it can be used without the phone, 
it's designed so that the phone can be left clipped in place on the back. This 
makes it very top-heavy, so a small fold-out leg has been fitted onto the 
battery cover to keep it from falling over. In this configuration, the unit is 
quite bulky, and is far too big for the most pockets.</p>
<p>The machine's ROM has been expanded. The 700LX contains a 
Hayes-compatible cellular modem for use with the cellphone only, and all 
the communications-aware programs (DataComm, cc:Mail, etc.) have been 
modified so that the phone appears as an extra COM port. A couple of 
additional applications have been added into the ROM, too, to handle fax 
send/receive and Short Messaging Service (SMS) facilities. These work 
well, but the integration is not all it could be. For instance, when an SMS 
message is received, you must run the SMS application and press F8 to tell 
it to fetch the message(s) from the phone. If you're expecting a fax call, you 
must run the Fax program and leave it in Receive mode. Because the DOS 
software doesn't multitask, you can't use the machine for anything else while 
it's waiting for a fax, and the 700LX won't automatically &quot;sleep&quot; while it's 
waiting. On the 200LX, the absence of multitasking isn't a major problem, 
as you can instantly switch between programs, but it's a nuisance that while 
the 700LX is communicating, you can't switch away.</p>
<p>We tested the fax facilities, cc:Mail client and terminal program, which all 
worked flawlessly, albeit at only 9600K. It's impressive to sit in the park 
while online to, say, CIX with a small, wireless unit, but beware that this can 
only be used with text-based services like bulletin boards, CompuServe etc. 
- you can't use services that require a special client like AOL unless you 
install a DOS client on a RAM card. A glaring omission is the absence of 
any Internet software; although a third-party Web client has just been 
released, we were unable to obtain it in time. Small DOS Internet packages 
could be used, but this means quitting from the 700LX's graphical shell to 
DOS, and installing apps on a RAM card.</p>
<p>There are other weaknesses with the software, too. The PC connectivity 
pack for the 200LX and 700LX is poor, comprising only a DOS version of 
the 700's built-in ROM software with very basic file-conversion tools. A 
special LapLink client for Windows 3.x is supplied, but this requires a TSR, 
so won't work with Windows 95 or NT, let alone non-PC systems. 
Furthermore, this is an &quot;optional extra&quot; for which HP charges more; nothing 
is included with the machine itself. It's not really suitable for taking your PC 
data with you unless you're an ACT user and buy Symantec's 95LX edition 
of that package - which drastically underuses the 200LX or 700LX.</p>
<p><font size=4>Conclusion</font></p>
<p>The OmniGo 700LX is just a bigger 200LX with fairly poorly-integrated 
comms facilities. The cc:Mail, fax and SMS programs are good, but could 
be better, and anything more will require additional DOS software to be 
loaded. The contrast with its smaller sibling is significant: the 200LX is an 
appealing little PC, and if it sounds useful to you and you've already got, or 
want, a Nokia 2110 phone, then the 700LX is worthwhile. If just you want 
a PDA, a Psion or Newton is probably more suitable, and with an external 
phone adaptor, these can offer similar facilities to the 700LX. If you want 
mobile Internet datacomms, the Nokia Communicator 9000 is a far more 
elegant solution.</p>
