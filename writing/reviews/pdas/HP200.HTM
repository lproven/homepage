<h1><font size=5>Hewlett-Packard HP200LX</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A good machine if PC compatibility is of prime importance, 
but the supplied applications aren't as streamlined as the Psion's. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Hewlett-Packard 0990 474747</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Companies have been striving to perfect an &quot;ultra-portable&quot; PC clone for 
more than a decade - certainly before the technology was really viable: the 
Atari Portfolio, the Poqet PC, and Sharp's PC3000. The culmination of this 
line is the HP200LX; surprisingly, from HP's calculator division rather than 
its PC unit.</p>
<p>The 200LX isn't strictly a &quot;PDA&quot;; unlike the Psion and most others, the HP 
really is a true PC, but more like an early 1980s one than any current 
machine. It has an Intel 80C186 processor, which runs at 7.91MHz, 2Mb 
of RAM, and one megabyte of ROM. Its screen is CGA, usually running in 
640 X 200 mode which is rather more than the Psion 3a and 3c's 480 X 
160. What this means is that the HP can run any DOS application that will 
fit into its 1.3Mb RAM drive. If that isn't enough, RAM cards of up to 
40Mb are readily available, and they're far cheaper than Psion's proprietary 
solid state devices. This is the machine's unique selling point - it is, as far as 
possible, non-proprietary. Whereas some PDAs, such as the Psion and 
Newton, can now muster an impressive range of after-market and 
third-party software, the HP can run thousands of off-the-shelf MS-DOS 
applications, and custom development is trivially easy on any ordinary PC 
using standard tools. No special development system is necessary and no 
special training for a PC programmer.</p>
<p>The 200LX comes with an impressive range of 22 applications in ROM as 
standard, including some cut-down versions of big-name desktop packages: 
Lotus 1-2-3, cc:Mail Mobile, Intuit's Pocket Quicken and Traveling 
Software's LapLink Remote. It also has its own set of HP applets for 
traditional PDA functions: a diary, address book, text editor and terminal 
emulator. Finally, there's an assortment of utilities such as a file manager, 
DOS shell, an icon-based application manager, two games and a rolling 
demo. The apps are very similar to Windows, and all the usual options are 
there including inter-app cut and paste and full on-line help.</p>
<p>Although some of the PDA applets are from HP and some from Lotus, they 
share a common look and feel. They're more flexible and feature-rich than 
the equivalents on the Psion, and streets ahead of the basic tools of the 
Newton or Pilot. This power, however, comes at a price, and although HP 
has gone to considerable lengths to make them easy and friendly, they're 
rather fussy and fiddly compared with Psion's streamlined system.</p>
<p>Although the keyboard is dauntingly complex and crowded-looking at first 
glance, it is, in fact, very usable once you become familiar with it. The 
buttons are small with large gaps between them and they make a distinct 
click when pressed, so it's easy to type fairly quickly and with a certain 
degree of accuracy. There are function keys along the top, as well as eight 
application keys, while the numbers are in a miniature numeric keypad on 
the right-hand side. One snag is that the print on the keyboard and default 
text size on screen is rather small, and often can't be enlarged.</p>
<p>The 200LX is well-equipped for connectivity, with both serial and infra-red 
ports as well as a Version 2 Type 2 PC Card slot, which in theory can 
accommodate RAM and Flash cards, modems, or even network interfaces 
etc - subject to the availability of MS-DOS drivers. Unfortunately, the 
special cable to connect to the proprietary serial port costs extra, and only 
comes with DOS software. There's also a third-party package for 
Windows, IntelliLink, which allows conversion to and from the internal file 
formats.</p>
<p><font size=4>Personal opinion</font></p>
<p>The 200LX isn't for everyone. The Psion is easier to learn and use, and is 
better suited to pocket computing needs than this very small PC with PC 
apps. The HP will really score with committed PC fans, however, for its 
mobile access to DOS apps. It's better than anything else I've used for text 
entry and editing, especially if you have access to a copy of, say, 
WordPerfect on a RAM card. The 200LX can accommodate an internal 
PCMCIA modem, but this isn't the boon it seems, as a modem intended for 
a laptop will drain its batteries in minutes - you need either an external 
modem or an external power supply. In this respect, the OmniGo 700LX is 
a better choice for mobile comms.</p>
<p>The &quot;pocket&quot; versions of the desktop apps really speak for themselves: 
Lotus 1-2-3 is a serious tool, old-fashioned but not too difficult even for a 
hardened Excel user. Not everyone is organised and methodical enough for 
personal finance packages, but if you are, Quicken is best of breed. There's 
a cc:Mail client for use with either an external modem or a PCMCIA 
version one, but users of other email systems (including Internet mail) would 
have to add a RAM card and install some DOS software. This, though, is 
the great strength of the HP: whilst PDAs with proprietary operating systems 
might have no such software, or only as an expensive option, DOS 
packages are plentiful and often very cheap or free. With enough extra 
memory, the 200LX can do almost anything a desktop can. Although it isn't 
the easiest or friendliest to use, it's probably the most flexible device on test 
here. What's more, it's very reasonably priced, as are the many standard PC 
parts and packages it can run.</p>
