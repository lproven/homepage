<hr>

<p>We'd all like to have £4,000 spare to buy one of the machines
described in this labs - even if it wasn't to spend on a PC!
However, if you can't afford one of these unashamedly high-end
machines, but still fancy running NT, here - in order of
importance - is a checklist of what you might need...</p>

<p>Memory: this is absolutely the most important factor. NT will
boot in 8Mb, but it's too slow to use in this little RAM. 16Mb
will give you a somewhat sluggish but usable workstation -
similar to Windows 3.x in 8Mb. 24Mb will be reasonably responsive
for normal desktop use, with a couple of programs open at all
times. 32Mb is ideal, if money is no object - the reason we've
specified 32Mb of RAM is that on a Pentium machine, where SIMMs
must be added in pairs, it makes more sense to go for two 16Mb
SIMMs and retain 2 empty SIMM slots for future expansion than to
go for two 8Mb and two 4Mb ones (giving 24Mb) - which would fill
all four slots.</p>

<p>Processor: this really isn't as important as you might think.
NT requires a 386-class CPU, but apart from that it's not too
fussy. A 386 will work, very slowly - there are a few patient
souls out there running 386sx NT fileservers which are actually
usable as fileservers, but you wouldn't enjoy using one as a
workstation - but a 486DX2 is fine, with enough memory. As
always, though, the faster, the better.</p>

<p>Hard disk: there are still some compatibility problems with
EIDE hard disks and non-DOS operating systems such as NT, OS/2
and UNIX. Older IDE drives are OK as long as they don't exceed
the IDE specification's maximum size of 512Mb - but that's quite
small when buying a drive today. For this reason, we specified
SCSI drives, which cost a little more, but are worth it in terms
of effort saved. </p>

<p>When it comes to space, NT is comparable to Windows 3 -
reserving 40Mb or so for the swapfile, you'll need an absolute
minimum of 40Mb to install at all, but a standard installation
will take more like 70Mb, - you could just about squeeze it onto
a 120Mb drive, but without any space for applications. To get the
benefits of NTFS, it's best to partition the disk - leave a small
partition for DOS (10Mb will do, but more if you have the room)
and install NT into its own partition, which is formatted to
NTFS. If you still want to run Windows 3 (or 95) as well, it's
best to split the disk in half - keep the DOS FAT partition under
512Mb to avoid wasteful 16Kb clusters, and put NT in what's left.</p>

<p>Amost any graphics card will work with NT, but some only in
VGA mode - you must check with the supplier. The only sound cards
directly supported by v3.5 are SoundBlaster, MediaVision and the
Windows Sound System - but ask the supplier, as some have written
their own drivers. Most standard network cards are fine, and
recent ones usually have NT drivers with them anyway. For
anything, though, if you're buying it for the purpose, choose
from Microsoft's Hardware Compatibility List wherever possible;
failing that, make sure the supplier can provide drivers, and if
at all possible, try before you buy.</p>
