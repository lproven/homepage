<h1><font size="5">Seventeen-inch monitors: how we tested</font></h1>

<p><font size="5"><em>Feature section</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p>PC Pro's usual performance testing measures the speed at which
a computer or component works, but this is obviously meaningless
when it comes to monitors, where the main difference is display
quality. Flat-panel displays aside, all monitors work in the same
way - magnets around the gun steer an electron beam around, while
separate circuitry switches the red, green and blue beams on and
off. This means that certain types of image are particularly hard
to display. </p>

<p>All our tests were performed with Sonera's DisplayMate for
Windows, which is possibly the most exhaustive set of monitor
tests around. It can generate hundreds of test patterns
specifically designed to show up flaws in monitors, and the
Windows version can do so at any resolution and colour-depth
supported by Windows. We tested at a resolution of 1,024 x 768
pixels, in 65,536 colours, as this is the commonest mode for this
size of screen. Whilst some of the monitors and cards can handle
the useful 1,152 x 864 resolution, 1,280 x 1,024 is too high for
most 17in monitors to cope.</p>

<p>We looked at several different areas:</p>

<p>Basic setup. This includes checking the contrast and
brightness controls are correctly set, and examining blank grey
and black screens for background interference. A blank screen
really should be blank, with no patterns, marks or distortions,
and a minimum of reflections.</p>

<p>Geometry and distortion. This covers two main areas; firstly,
we looked at the geometry of the screen - with the image size
properly adjusted, we checked whether images on screen are
accurately represented on the monitor. For instance, squares
should be truly square, lines straight, and a ten-pixel gap
should be the same length all over the tube. Secondly, we checked
regulation. This uses large blinking boxes of different sizes
surrounded by a thin line - as the box flashes on and off, on
many monitors the line moves, and whilst a millimetre or so is
acceptable, more than 3mm is bad. You can try this with a
spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel - hold a sheet of paper up to
the screen along one edge, then select the whole sheet: the edge
of the display shouldn't move.</p>

<p>Sharpness and resolution. This series of tests looks at the
ability of the monitor to display fine detail, using patterns of
fine horizontal and vertical lines. We examined both ultra-fine
detail and overall focus. Dividing a monitor's dot pitch by its
horizontal or vertical size yields the theoretical number of
pixels it can display: for instance, the Iiyama Pro's screen is
325mm across, which with a dot pitch of 0.25mm means it should be
able to display 1,300 separate pixels across the screen. </p>

<p>Colour and greyscale. Here, we examined colour registration -
whether red, green and blue pixels lines up - and streaking and
ghosting, as shown by images containing sharp transitions from
bright to grey, which are harder to show than bright to dark.</p>
