<h1><font size=5>The HM Minstrel Alpha/166</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>This is one of the first PC-type machines based on Digital's Alpha AXP 
RISC processor not to be manufactured by Digital themselves. The Alpha 
chip is the fastest microprocessor in the world - the latest versions, built on 
the &quot;EV5&quot; process, run at an incredible 375MHz - nearly three times faster 
than the fastest Pentium. These chips are currently very expensive, only 
appearing in Digital's high-end minicomputers - HM's fastest machine is 
based on a 266MHz Alpha, but unfortunately they couldn't supply one of 
these in time for review, so we got the older 166MHz version.</p>
<p>In appearance, the Minstrel looks just like a PC - inside and out. The Alpha 
processor's bigger than a Pentium, but with a heatsink literally bolted on top, 
it's hard to tell. The motherboard has a mixture of ISA and PCI slots, and 
the usual serial and parallel ports; graphics are provided by a Diamond 
Stealth 64 PCI card. It's well-specified: 32Mb of RAM, a 4Gb SCSI hard 
disk and a DAT drive for backup. So far, much like a high-end PC.</p>
<p>But it isn't.</p>
<p>Turn it on, and it loads its Digital-written firmware - this machine's equivalent 
of a BIOS - from a special directory on the hard disk. Then it asks you 
what operating system you wish to load - although the only choice is 
Windows NT 3.51. Once NT starts to load, it looks much like normal 
Windows 3.x, and after you've logged-in, the usual Windows desktop 
appears. You can run most Windows 3.x and MS-DOS programs just like 
always - but very slowly. The Alpha is a completely different processor 
from Intel's x86 series, and can't run Intel code directly. NT runs Intel 
programs on non-Intel machines using a licensed version of Insignia 
Solutions' 80286 CPU emulator, as used in SoftPC and SoftWindows - 
which are PC emulators for RISC computers such as Apple's Power 
Macintoshes. It interprets Intel code into Alpha code on the fly, which, 
although a very impressive technical achievement, means that Intel code runs 
at 20% of the speed of Alpha code at best. You can use Intel software on 
an Alpha, but it runs at the speed of a 386/40 or 486/25 - pretty slow by 
today's standards. Also, the emulated processor is a 286, so 386-specific 
software won't run at all; you therefore can't run Intel 32-bit Windows 
programs on non-Intel versions of NT. Native Alpha software flies along - 
the NT versions of Microsoft Word and Excel come with Alpha versions, 
and these run at a speed roughly equivalent to a 125MHz Pentium, if there 
was such a chip. A 266MHz Alpha should comfortably outpace any 
Pentium, and by the time the P6 is readily available, the Alpha should have 
passed 400MHz.</p>
<p>However, running PC software isn't really the purpose of this machine. The 
Minstrel Alpha looks like a PC, but it isn't - if anything, it's a Digital UNIX 
workstation in deep disguise. If you're looking for a fast PC, look 
elsewhere. If you are looking for a fast NT workstation that will only be 
used for a few specific programs - or you're writing your own - then it's a 
good deal. It's cheaper than most workstations, and yet you can use 
cheaper PC components, whilst retaining the familiar environment - and 
even software, at the penalty of speed.</p>
