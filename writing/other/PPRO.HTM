<h2><font size="3">Dell Optiplex Pentium Pro 150MHz</font></h2>

<p>The machine we looked at was a prototype, using a debug
version of the motherboard chipset and BIOS; as such, it's not as
fast as it will be using a fully finished motherboard. However,
the difference should be small, especially as the BIOS isn't used
by NT at all. Even allowing for that, it's a very fast PC,
although it really only shows its heels to a Pentium when running
CPU-intensive 32-bit code.</p>

<h2><font size="3">Benchmark results</font></h2>

<p>CorelDRAW's redraw times were an impressive one-third faster
than on the Pentium-133 machine, but oddly Corel's full-screen
preview wouldn't work - we just got a blank screen. As this
worked on the Pentium computer, using the same hard disk and
graphics card, it's probably a CPU or motherboard glitch, but
such things are to be expected; it's still very early days for
Pentium Pro PCs. Loading times were not much improved, as this
depends more on the hard disk - a faster CPU doesn't really help.</p>

<p>Photoshop was less impressive, registering an improvement of
only 12%. With 64Mb of RAM, even our 8Mb test image can be
manipulated entirely in memory, without the hard disk being
accessed at all, so this is a test of pure CPU power, compared to
the Corel test which involves drawing to the screen as well.
Calculating the effects of a filter on an image takes
floating-point maths: basically, Photoshop is simulating putting
a piece of special glass in front of the lens of the virtual
&quot;camera.&quot; Changing all the millions of pixels in the
image, though, is mainly an integer operation. Photoshop always
operates internally in 24-bit &quot;true colour&quot;, whatever
the screen resolution - in our test, whilst each filter took some
ten seconds to apply, redrawing the screen took only a fraction
of a second, so there's little difference between 8-bit and
24-bit display modes, and we've left the 8-bit mode results out.</p>

<p>The Caligari TrueSpace test showed the biggest speed gains of
all. Every pixel in each frame is rendered individually, during
which time the picture slowly appears on the screen; this process
is so gradual that the speed of the graphics card has little
impact. When complete, it's saved to disk and the program
progresses to the next frame, but the time taken to save is
insignificant to the overall test: it's basically pure
floating-point 32-bit number crunching. Similarly to Photoshop,
the display mode has little impact on the final times, so we've
omitted the 256-colour results. This program showed a stunning
44% increase - comparable with the jump from a 486 to a Pentium.</p>

<p>Both the Excel tests fared well. We have two separate
benchmarks for this package, a &quot;business&quot; one, which
mainly uses simple arithmetic (using mostly just two decimal
places) and some sorting, and a scientific one with more
functions and advanced floating-point maths; both draw a variety
of charts. The Pentium Pro's floating-point maths performance is
pretty good, so the scientific test benefits slightly more, but
both were a gratifying one-third faster than the Pentium-133. The
many figures and comparatively simple charts don't really stretch
the graphics card, and the scientific test in particular was much
faster in 256 colours than in 16 million.</p>

<p>The final 32-bit application is Word. This test uses no
colour, and exercises the graphics card's ability to redraw text
quickly - something which is much faster in 256 colours than in
16 million, simply because there's only one-third as much screen
data to shift around. Despite this, it was surprising that the
Word test in true colour mode was noticeably slower on the
Pentium Pro - this seems to highlight the motherboard's
inefficiency at getting data to and from the graphics card
quickly enough. In 256 colours, the situation is reversed and the
Pentium Pro is far faster, gaining a few percent more than even
TrueSpace.</p>

<p>Finally come the 16-bit applications, Pagemaker and Access.
The results for Access are surprising and pleasing: despite the
acknowledge fact that a Pentium Pro is slower on 16-bit code than
a Pentium, the Access test is faster on the Pentium Pro! This is
probably down to the massive amounts of RAM in this machine: the
whole program and database sit in NT's disk cache. Whilst the
test is designed to exercise the hard disk, on this machine it's
actually testing NT's caching code. Although with a more moderate
amount of memory, this would slow down a lot, it does go to show
that a slower CPU needn't mean a slower PC. Pagemaker ran quite
slowly in true colour mode, losing nearly 20% to the Pentium-133;
however, in 256 colours, it did rather better, beating the older
CPU by a third.</p>

<h2><font size="3">Summary</font></h2>

<p>Overall, the Dell Pentium Pro is a faster machine than an
identically-equipped Pentium 133, but only by a modest 15-25%.
The results are complicated by the fact that its #9 Imagine 128
graphics card is designed for true colour work, where the
immature design of the motherboard and chipset really let it
down. In a more typical 256-colour mode, the machine does a lot
better, but the graphics card becomes a handicap. Our tests
encompass both 32-bit and a smaller amount of 16-bit software -
if you were buying a machine like this, you would probably have a
specific purpose in mind. Running mainly with a couple of
selected 32-bit programs, and matched to an appropriate graphics
card, the machine should be substantially faster than a
Pentium-133, by around a third to a half. However, it's let down
by an immature chipset; given another few months of development,
and with a wider choice of 32-bit Windows software, it will
really shine.</p>

<h2><font size="4">Apricot LX650</font></h2>

<h2><font size="3">What's in the box</font></h2>

<p>The Apricot is the only machine we've seen so far that doesn't
use an Intel motherboard, although like the other machines it's
based on Intel's Orion GX chipset. The motherboard is one of
Apricot's own LX series, although unlike some of their machines,
it doesn't include an Ethernet interface; what it does have is
integrated graphics using a Cirrus Logic 5436 chipset, as well as
all the usual interfaces: EIDE, parallel, serial, PS/2 mouse and
keyboard ports. An option that may be added later is an infra-red
port for wireless communications with printers, notebooks or
pocket computers. Another interesting feature is its memory
slots: rather than the usual 72-pin SIMMs, which contain 32-bit
wide memory, this motherboard takes 64-bit DIMMs (Dual Inline
Memory Modules). This means that DIMMs can be added singly,
unlike SIMMs which must be added in pairs - this gives more
flexiblity, but they will be harder to find for a while yet. For
the review machine, Apricot had added a Stealth 64 Video VRAM PCI
graphics card, a more sensible choice for true-colour work than
the inbuilt graphics. Whilst EIDE is an economical option for
most PCs, SCSI remains the storage system of choice for high-end
machines - into which category all Pentium Pros definitely fall
at the moment! As such, Apricot chose an Adaptec 2940 PCI fast
SCSI host adaptor, coupled to a Seagate 2Gb hard disk and Sony
quad-speed CD-ROM - just about the best components that (quite a
lot of) money can buy. </p>

<h2><font size="3">Benchtest results</font></h2>

<p>All PC Pro's benchmarks are run in a 1024x768 screen mode, but
unfortunately the Apricot's Stealth card had only 2Mb of video
RAM - insufficient for the true colour at this resolution. We
used the built-in card for testing in 256 colours, and added an
Hercules Terminator (based around the same S3 968 chipset as the
Stealth) for true-colour tests. As the Hercules only came with
drivers for older versions of NT, and Hercules had no NT drivers
in their CompuServe forum, we had to use NT's generic S3 drivers,
reducing the machine's true colour performance slightly. This was
one of a number of minor difficulties which reflect the immature
nature of these machines. One other difference is that the
Apricot's tests were run from its SCSI drive, unlike the EIDE
machines, in which we installed PC Pro's own drive and ran the
tests from there.</p>

<p>In the CorelDRAW test, the Apricot was marginally the slowest
of the three in true colour mode, but this is probably the fault
of the non-specific screen drivers. In contrast, in 256 colours,
it's just in the lead, but there's only 2% between fastest and
slowest - not a significant difference.</p>

<p>The Photoshop test places it between the other two machines in
both colour depths.</p>

<p>In TrueSpace, it does very well, clearly the fastest of the
trio. This test involves more disk access than most, where the
SCSI disk will help; also, the Apricot seems to have the edge on
raw CPU bandwidth.</p>

<p>The 16-bit Pagemaker test places it between the others again,
and slightly slower than the Pentium machine in both 8-bit and
24-bit colour. In true colour, the Apricot's Access result is
again middling, but in 256 colours it pips both of the others to
the post, and is still faster than the Pentium with this 16-bit
program.</p>

<p>In the Word and Excel tests, the Apricot does well in 256
colours, but again it's poorer in true colour where Hercules card
has to move a lot of text around.</p>

<h2><font size="3">Conclusion</font></h2>

<p>The Apricot has a good, fast hard disk subsystem and a
polished motherboard design, but its true colour results are
handicapped by NT's generic S3 graphics drivers. Nonetheless, it
has the best overall result in both colour depths. Shipping
machines will have better-chosen graphics adapters, and as such
will probably be the fastest of the first wave of Pentium Pro
PCs.</p>

<h2><font size="4">Viglen Genie Pro 150</font></h2>

<p>This machine performed similarly to the Dell, with the same
amount of memory and the same hard disk drive but a different
graphics card - a Diamond Stealth 64 968 with 4Mb of VRAM, which
isn't quite equal to the Imagine 128 in true colour, but beats it
in 256. In the very CPU-intensive TrueSpace and Corel tests, it
was a few seconds ahead of the Dell; this is probably thanks to
the final-version chipset and motherboard, although it sill had a
beta BIOS. Oddly, though, it was slightly slower in Photoshop.
Where the Stealth card had to move a lot of screen data around in
true colour mode, the machine fell down badly, but in 256 colours
it gave very similar timings to the Dell. </p>

<h1><font size="4"><em>Box:</em> Alternatives to the Pentium and
Pentium Pro</font></h1>

<p>All IBM-compatible PCs use central processors which are either
members of Intel's 80x86 range, or are compatible with them; they
have to, because the great strength of the PC is the biggest
selection of software of any computer - and it's all written for
x86 processors. However, as the &quot;What's wrong with the
Pentium Pro?&quot; box describes, this advantage is becoming a
problem. Intel-based PCs have to compete with other,
non-IBM-compatible computers based around newer processor
designs, which are not so restricted by the need for
backwards-compatibility because no other type of computer has
such a legacy of software and users. Most of the innovations in
recent Intel chips had been seen much earlier in competing RISC
designs: the 486 is a scalar design, meaning that it has a
pipeline, used in several RISC chips in the 1980's, as was the
Pentium's superscalar architecture, with multiple pipelines.</p>

<p>About a decade ago, when some influential customers refused to
use x86 chips as long as they had only one source, Intel licensed
AMD and Harris to produce &quot;clones&quot; of their 286
processor, and AMD still make their own brand of 486 today, which
is just different enough from Intel's to avoid legal action.
Other companies have independently produced compatible chips -
primarily Cyrix, who sell their own design of 486. The
difficulties of building a superscalar x86 chip are many, though,
so the builders of Intel-compatible processors face two problems:
not only must they design a complex chip that's faster than a
486, they also have to do it in a way sufficiently different from
Intel that they won't get sued. AMD and Cyrix have both been
working on just this for years, but neither have a product that's
ready for market yet - and Intel have already finished the
Pentium's successor, the Pentium Pro. Only one company have a
Pentium-class chip on sale: NexGen with their Nx586. In
development since before the 486, this uses a similar but
slightly more advanced design compared to the Pentium, meaning
that it's slightly faster than a Pentium at the same clock speed.
However, it lacks the Pentium's built-in floating point unit, and
needs a different socket, so it won't fit onto a Pentium
motherboard. Technicalities aside, NexGen's also attacking a very
well-established competitor.</p>

<p>Although Intel's difficulties developing the x86 family also
handicap its cloners, there are other companies aiming for the
same market with no such hindrances. The main alternative to
IBM-compatible PCs for a decade has been Apple with the
Macintosh, who have very successfully moved their entire range
from Motorola 680x0 CPUs to a new and completely incompatible
32-bit RISC processor ramge, the PowerPC, codesigned by Motorola
and IBM. The current fastest PowerPC, the 150MHz PPC604, is
roughly twice as fast as Pentium-133, and the range is used by
two of the biggest PC manufacturers in the world - it may prove
to be Intel's most dangerous rival.</p>

<p>Intel and Motorola's present offerings are basically 32-bit
designs, although Motorola's 64-bit PPC620 is nearly ready - but
some companies have had 64-bit processors on sale for a year or
more. Digital, who aside from making Intel-based PCs has long
been a leader in minicomputers and workstations, has the world's
fastest microprocessor, the Alpha AXP, and Silicon Graphics'
subsidiary MIPS has the R4x00 and R8000. All of these chips are
established in their current markets, and they can all run
Windows NT, making it relatively easy for software companies to
convert their Windows software to these chips.</p>

<p>Intel's plans for the future of the x86 line are to combine it
with Hewlett-Packard's Precision Architecture chip to create a
modern RISC processor that can run existing x86 software, which
is a very difficult and ambitious project - and they have many
impatient rivals.</p>

<h1><font size="4"><em>Summing up</em></font></h1>

<p>None of the machines we saw was 100% finished and ready to go
on sale, but it's still very early days - these machines were the
only ones of their type that their manufacturers had in the
country at the time. The Apricot did best overall, but they all
have strong and weak points - for example, the Dell has a superb
graphics adaptor that its motherboard can't fully exploit,
whereas the Apricot's good motherboard and SCSI storage couldn't
be matched with an appropriate graphics card. The Viglen was the
only machine to have just one of its pair of memory banks filled
- when both are filled, the Orion chipset uses a technique called
memory interleaving to spread the load between the two, which the
Apricot and Dell both could use, and this pulls the Viglen's
results down a little.</p>

<p>The Pentium Pro really needs pure 32-bit software, and this
means Windows NT. One aspect of all these systems that stood out,
as it did some months ago in PC Pro's Labs test on NT
Workstations, is that manufacturers don't seem to know how to
fine-tune an NT system to give its best. One machine had a
FAT-format hard disk, and none of them came with the latest NT
Service Pack - a quarterly maintenance kit from Microsoft
containing bug-fixes and updated drivers.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of a processor, system manufacturers
gradually refine the various supporting subsystems, driver
software and so on to get the best results from the CPU. The
Pentium Pro is a very different animal from its predecessor - it
needs time for the fine-tuning of motherboards and chipsets, and
to accumulate a decent base of 32-bit Windows software. At
present, cards and drivers are designed and optimised for Pentium
or 486 machines. The Pentium Pro isn't such a big increase in
performance as the Pentium was, and whilst all three PCs were
exceptionally fast computers, the difference from a 133MHz
Pentium isn't great. At certain tasks, they will excel and give
30-50% better performance than a Pentium, but in general daily
use the difference will be much smaller, and it would almost
disappear with Windows 95 and 16-bit applications. There are
faster Pentiums coming, too - 150 and 166MHz chips should be with
us soon. It will take quite a while for the Pentium Pro to really
show its potential.</p>
