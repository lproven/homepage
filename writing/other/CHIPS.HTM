<p>A few years ago, Intel&#146;s and AMD&#146;s clock-tripled
486s were released, and it was generally agreed that the 486 was
reaching the end of its useful life. In response, Intel started
to cut the price of the Pentium processor to 486 levels, so that
you could buy a Pentium-based system for little more than a
well-specified 486. However, those early 60/66MHz Pentiums were
little faster than good 486s, having 5V motherboards, inefficient
chipsets, and slow RAM, cache and disks; they&#146;re also
expensive to upgrade. It was only with the later,
clock-multiplied, 3.3V Pentium that the chip really started to
pull ahead of its ancestor.</p>

<p>Now, the Pentium is nearing the end of the line, and Intel is
chopping Pentium Pro prices to compete. At the time of writing,
Dell will supply a Pentium Pro 200 system (with 16Mb of RAM) for
only £40 more than this month&#146;s Pentium 200 (with 32Mb of
RAM). Other vendors will supply a Cyrix P200+ for less. We
compared the performance of three of the best examples of each
type: a 200MHz Pentium in an Intel Triton VX motherboard, with
SDRAM; a Cyrix 150MHz 6x86 in a Boston Triton HX board; and a
Pentium Pro 200, in an Intel &quot;Natoma&quot; 440FX board, both
with EDO DRAM. The same Western Digital Caviar 3Gb EIDE hard
drive and 4Mb Matrox Millennium graphics card was used in all
three systems, so that the same copy of Windows 95 could be
tested on three different CPU/motherboard combinations.</p>

<p>In PC Pro&#146;s standard Windows benchmarks, the Pentium
processor came slowest of all; the Cyrix is 6% faster, and the
Pentium Pro is 9% faster - especially impressive, since much of
the test are 16-bit. However, the difference is pretty small. We
also ran two extra tests, designed to be very intensive on 32-bit
and floating-point CPU performance: the Quake (version 1.01)
frame rate test, and a render in Caligari TrueSpace 2. In both of
these, the Pentium Pro is some 16-25% faster than the Pentium,
but the Cyrix fares badly, running 50% slower in Quake and 100%
slower in TrueSpace. The Cyrix chip was optimised for general
integer work, and intensive fares badly at intensive maths.</p>

<p>It&#146;s hard to call a clear winner: for general business
use, the Cyrix gives the best bang-for-the-buck, but for the
latest games and graphics, the Pentium Pro is starting to pull
ahead, although it still costs a little more, and gives its best
when using a fully 32-bit OS such as Windows NT. However, in
early 1997, MMX-enhanced versions of all three chips should
appear, and the tables may turn again.</p>
