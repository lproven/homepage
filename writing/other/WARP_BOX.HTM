<h2><font size="4">How does OS/2 Warp compare to NT?</font></h2>

<p>Unlike Windows 95, which contains significant amounts of
16-bit code and runs on top of MS-DOS, Windows NT is a completely
self-contained operating system, written entirely in 32-bit code
- characteristics which it shares with IBM's alternative
operating system for PCs, OS/2, version 3 of which is generally
known as Warp. In fact, NT is a remote descendant of OS/2 version
1, which was co-developed in the mid-80s by IBM and Microsoft.</p>

<p>OS/2 currently only runs on Intel-based PCs, although IBM are
working on a PowerPC version. It's been on sale since 1987, and
can run several different types of software as well as its own
OS/2 programs. Although Warp doesn't load from DOS like Windows 3
and 95, it includes a DOS emulator for running DOS software -
this will even run Windows 3.x. You can start a full-screen
Windows session, which gives you the normal Windows desktop,
Program Manager and all, or you can run a Windows program in a
window on the Warp desktop, complete with cut-and-paste and DDE
with other Windows or OS/2 programs.</p>

<p>Native OS/2 software is comparatively scarce; while there are
plenty of small public domain and shareware programs, there
aren't many major applications compared to Windows or the Apple
Macintosh. Whilst the ability to run Windows programs means that
this isn't critical, some of the additional benefits of Warp,
such as long filenames and better memory-management, are only
available to native Warp software. The Workplace Shell (WPS) is a
major benefit that applies to all software - it's a complete
icon-based object-oriented user interface, of which the Windows
95 Explorer is a pale shadow. The WPS is deep and complex, and
takes time to learn, but it is probably the richest interface on
any computer today. Warp's High Performance Filing System (HPFS)
makes more efficient use of larger (over 255Mb) hard disks than
Windows 95's FAT, and is faster and more resistant to corruption
and data loss.</p>

<p>The other pros and cons of Warp also apply to NT: their clean,
built-from-scratch design compared with Windows 3 means that the
system is generally more stable and less prone to crashing. If a
program does fail, it is far less likely to crash the whole
computer. They both require specific device drivers for all the
hardware you wish to use with them, and are far less tolerant of
malfunctioning or below-specification hardware than DOS. Neither
of them can run Windows programs that require Windows 3 virtual
device drivers (VxDs), although Warp is generally more compatible
with Windows 3 software than NT. One major drawback of the
current edition of Warp is that is has no networking support,
unlike Windows for Workgroups and NT. There are readily-available
clients for networks based on LAN Manager, NT Server or Novell
Netware, but there is no peer-to-peer functionality. This is
coming soon in the separate Warp Connect version of Warp, which
will cost more.</p>

<p>The short-term future of Windows is Windows 95, and NT will
gain from Windows 95-specific software as and when it appears.
OS/2 can't run Windows 95 32-bit software, and it seems doubtful
that it ever will, so unless it carves itself its own niche in
the PC market its future is uncertain.</p>
