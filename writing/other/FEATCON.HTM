<p>A graphics card essentially comprises two functional units: a
frame buffer, the area of video memory in which the screen image
is drawn, and the graphics chip which builds up that image from
the commands sent by the operating system to draw letters and
shapes and painting bitmaps. This is no help if you want to show
a moving TV image: video has different requirements, such as
conversion from TV's YUV (luminance/chrominance) colour model to
computers' RGB (red:green:blue) and resizing a video image on the
fly. These can be done in software if the PC's CPU is fast
enough, but they're best handled by separate hardware. Since this
costs extra, it's not usually built-in, but located on an
optional separate card. As this has to be displayed on the same
screen, the video image must be passed through to the main
graphics card's frame buffer, bypassing the graphics circuitry -
the function of the feature connector. </p>

<p>The original feature connector was part of IBM's VGA
specification, and so is limited to the capabilities of the VGA
display: an image of either 320x200 pixels in 256 colours or
640x480 in 16, at a refresh rate of 60MHz. Although many SuperVGA
adaptors have this connector, it's never been very popular,
partly because the 286 and 386-based PCs of the late 80s lacked
the bandwidth or storage to handle video. In today's world of
100+MHz Pentium-class processors, handling video streams is
becoming viable, but the VGA feature connector can't cope. </p>

<p>Many of the enhancements of modern video cards are derived
from standards set by the Video Electronics Standards Authority,
VESA. One of these is VAFC: the VESA Advanced Feature Connector.
This increases the speed, bus width and capabilities of the old
design, allowing true-colour images at high refresh rates.
However, both this and its predecessor have the same limitation:
the video board has to produce the TV picture independently of
the graphics card and then hand the result over for display. This
means that the video board has to have its own memory, as well as
that on the graphics card - duplicating one of the most expensive
components in the system, and so making the upgrade comparatively
expensive. Also, a modern system has to produce high- can
true-colour displays, which requires a RAMDAC - and in a VAFC
system, both the graphics accelerator and the video decoder must
access this component, necessitating an expensive dual-ported
RAMDAC. </p>

<p>Despite its limitations, the VAFC approach works, and it
requires minimal changes to the design of the main graphics card,
instead transferring the cost to the daughterboard. Several of
the cards in this Labs include a VAFC, or S3's proprietary
&quot;Scenic Highway&quot; local peripheral bus, which is a
superset of the VAFC. Scenic Highway allows a simple MPEG-1
decoder and/or video digitiser to be connected to a card based on
certain S3 chipsets (such as the Trio64V+ or 968). These boards
just perform the digitisation or decoding: the graphics card does
the rest of the work, converting YUV to RGB and scaling the video
image.</p>

<p>The VGA/VESA method allows a cheap and simple way of
connecting just one video device to a graphics card, which can
put a single video image on-screen. For applications where this
is insufficient, such as videconferencing with its several
independent video images, there is the VESA Media Channel (VMC).
VMC provides a separate, high-speed bus allowing up to 7 devices
to exchange uncompressed video data independently of the system
bus, using a single frame buffer. However, the extra cost of a
VMC interface means that it's mainly used in high-end cards such
as VideoLogic's GraphicStar 700. </p>

<p>In time, increases in CPU power and bus bandwidth will
probably mean that video handling is performed by the CPU, and
Intel already claim that the capacity of the PCI bus makes
separate video buses unneccesary. It may already be too late for
anything else to get a grip.</p>
