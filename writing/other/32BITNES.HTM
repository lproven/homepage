<h1><font size="4">32-bitness - is it the Answer to The Ultimate
Question?</font></h1>

<hr>

<p>There are several reasons why 32-bit PC software is held as
superior to 16-bit alternatives. In the context of Intel-based
PCs, &quot;32-bit&quot; means that the program is composed of
code designed for the 386 processor (which uses the same code as
the 486 and Pentium). Windows 3.x and most current Windows
programs are predominantly written in 286 code, and so suffer
from several of the limitations of the 286 processor.</p>

<p>The most serious of these is memory segmentation. To preserve
compatibility with the older 8088 and 8080 processors, the 286
can only handle memory in 64 kilobyte chunks called segments -
larger sizes must be split into segment-sized pieces. This
restriction means that much software can only handle 64k of data
at a time - for example, the Windows Notepad, or the infamous
Windows resources limits. Handling larger volumes is possible,
but more difficult for the programmer, as well as being
relatively slow. In contrast, the 386 code runs in a
&quot;flat&quot; memory space - all memory is handled as one big
segment, making memory access easier and faster.</p>

<p>Also, the 386 processor offers hardware-based memory
protection - programs can be prevented from accessing each
others' memory, so if one program goes wrong, it should not
affect the others. Presently, under Windows 3.x, if one program
crashes, it's quite likely the whole Windows system will lock up;
32-bit operating systems are far more resistant to this.</p>

<p>The other benefits of 32-bit code are less important. The 386
chip can access up to 4 Gigabytes - 4,096Mb - of memory, whereas
the 286 was limited to 16Mb, the maximum file size of many 16-bit
Windows programs. This is also part of the reason that Windows
3's performance doesn't improve much on machines with more than
16Mb - which will be commonplace soon.</p>

<p>Windows NT, OS/2 Warp and Windows 95 are all written mainly in
32-bit code; NT exclusively so, whilst OS/2 still has some
insignificant leftovers from the 16-bit OS/2 v1. Major parts of
the core of Windows 95 are still 16-bit, because to rewrite them
would reduce its very high level of compatibility with 16-bit
Windows software; this does, however, compromise its stability
and multitasking compared to the &quot;pure&quot; 32-bit systems
- only time and experience will show how well Microsoft has
worked around this.</p>
