<hr>

<p>NT 4 is a remarkable piece of software, but it is not the
be-all and end-all of operating systems. Far from it. It's not
even everything MS had promised it would be. The biggest thing
that NT 4 is not is Cairo, the all-new object-oriented NT that MS
has been talking about for years. Instead, the current product
has had a facelift and a tummy tuck.</p>

<p>It has a neat user interface, sure - but it isn't the Cairo
shell, it's the simplified, cut-down Windows 95 Explorer ported
back onto NT. The &quot;Desktop&quot; is just a directory under
C:\WINNT, and shortcuts are .LNK files instead of proper symbolic
links in the filesystem. </p>

<p>Moving the graphical windowing system (the Graphics Device
Interface, or GDI) into the kernel has required a substantial
rewrite, which will almost certainly introduce new bugs that will
take time to find and fix. Also, it needs completely new graphics
card drivers, and they too will have bugs.</p>

<p>Finally, this goes completely counter to current thinking in
operating system design circles, which today favours
&quot;microkernel&quot; systems, in which the core of the whole
operating system is kept as small and simple as possible and all
the supporting functionality is moved out into independent
subsystems. This yields a more portable, flexible design, which
is theoretically more robust, as it makes the critical kernel
less vulnerable to problems in the rest of the system. Microsoft
has long claimed - very dubiously - that NT is an MK system, but
now this looks even more ridiculous than before.</p>

<p>Backwards-compatibility was never the primary objective for
NT, but this has been further reduced. NT is at heart a
development of OS/2, and has always supported OS/2 text-mode
programs and OS/2 HPFS-formatted disks. MS even had a working
Presentation Manager subsystem for running 16-bit OS/2 graphical
applications, but never officially released it. Now that MS no
longer has any OS/2 applications in its portfolio, it looks like
OS/2 support will be dropped from NT - HPFS is probably just the
first to go.</p>

<p>On the network front, NT 4 Server still relies on the tired
old domain system - there are no distributed directory services.
Exchange was meant to use the Cairo unified Object Filing System,
but as the OFS isn't in NT4, Exchange Server remains a separate
product - for now. The Internet Information Server functionality
is built-in, but the Catapult Internet proxy server wasn't ready
in time.</p>

<p>Version 4 is the biggest upgrade NT has ever had, but it's
still a comparatively minor step forwards, and the purity of its
design has been compromised for improved performance. There's no
easy way to upgrade a Windows 95 system, and interoperating with
OS/2 is harder than ever. It's very tempting to desktop
workstation users, but not as much so to network administrators.
Certainly, no sensible SysAdm would dream of rolling it out onto
their servers, at least not until the first Service Pack is
released - if then.</p>

<p>8/10, Gates. Good try, but could do better.</p>
