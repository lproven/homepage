<h1><font size="5">NT 4 arrives at last</font></h1>

<p><font size="4"><em>News story</em></font></p>

<hr>

<p>On the 30th July, Microsoft sent version 4 of Windows NT to
manufacturing - finished product should be be appearing in the
shops by around nth Octember. Despite its name, this is the first
major overhaul of Microsoft's flagship operating system - the
first version was called 3.1. Although there are several
important new features, this is primarily a facelift to bring
NT's user interface into line with Windows 95.</p>

<h2><font size="3">What's there?</font></h2>

<p>The most obvious difference is that NT now uses the same
Explorer front-end as Windows 95, and the two are visually
indistinguishable. Technologically, the biggest change has been
the integration of the graphics subsystem into the kernel. When
NT was originally designed, the graphical user interface was to
be an optional component, and although this never happened with
any shipping version, it still operated as a separate, discrete
program unit. Now, it's been moved into the core of the operating
system, resulting in a smaller, faster whole.</p>

<h2><font size="3">What's not?</font></h2>

<p>Several expected features are missing, though. Unlike version
3, NT 4 no longer supports OS/2's HPFS disk format at all. You
can't upgrade an installation of Windows 95 to NT 4, but instead
must reinstall everything, and NT 4 lacks Windows 95's support
for Plug 'n' Play hardware installation or notebook power
management. Some of these will be forthcoming, but even in their
absence NT 4 is a compelling upgrade for users of earlier
versions of NT, and Windows 3 power users who have been holding
off from Windows 95 while waiting for its higher-end cousin to
arrive.</p>
