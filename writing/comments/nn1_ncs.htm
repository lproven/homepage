<p><font size=4>Comment - So you think you know about NCs</font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>From Network News magazine, VNU Business Publications</em></font></p>
<hr>
<p>Few subjects have caused more hype and FUD* than the Network Computer &quot;revolution&quot;. Yet it seems to me 
that many people, inside the business and out, still don&#146;t really understand what NCs are all about, so I&#146;m going 
to talk about some common misconceptions.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#146;re just dumb terminals.&quot; This is the biggie, and it&#146;s completely wrong. The whole concept of the NC is 
based on local program execution. Processing power (and, indeed, RAM and disk space) is cheap now; what 
costs is admin time maintaining hundreds of individual machines. Stories of super-thin clients and fat servers 
mainly come from server vendors. Still, you can run a terminal emulator on them if you like.</p>
<p>&quot;They only run Java.&quot; Java is a neat idea, sure, but no-one is telling you to dump all your apps and start over. 
There&#146;s no reason why an NC can&#146;t run DOS, Windows or MacOS apps &#150; all it needs is either an NC OS 
that supports them, or an appropriately modified version of the original OS.</p>
<p>&quot;They load everything over the network.&quot; Yes, but not every time. Diskless NCs are the cheapo boxes that get 
waved around at press conferences. Until LANs get really fast, it will be much easier to use a local hard drive 
as a cache. Only configuration changes come over the wire.</p>
<p>Is this starting to sound familiar? Are you thinking &quot;he&#146;s just describing diskless workstations&quot;? Well, nearly. 
The big snag with diskless workstations is varying hardware; existing OSs don&#146;t take well to the hardware 
changing underneath them. An NC OS has to be able to recognise and use whatever hardware it finds, first 
time, without needing to change configuration files and reboot. Nothing needs to be kept on the local machine, 
and each workstation doesn&#146;t need an individual setup kept on the server. This is what&#146;s termed stateless 
operation, and it is the hard part to implement &#150; but that&#146;s the vendor&#146;s problem, not yours. An NC OS could 
even run on existing PC or Mac hardware; all that&#146;s needed is a version of the OS that joins the network as the 
first action on loading, and gets the rest from the server &#150; through a cache, of course. Back to the days of client 
OSs that fit, uncompressed, on a single floppy&#133;</p>
<p>The perception problem is due, at least in part, to the fact that some of the people promoting the NC concept 
want to humble and supplant the existing desktop vendors &#150; but that&#146;s just politics. If you specify, purchase or 
support networked PCs or Macs, ignore or dismiss the NC at your peril. It&#146;s not a new way of building 
computers or software, and it isn&#146;t the greatest revolution in computers since the micro &#150; it&#146;s just a shift in 
attitudes. But it could be the most important change ever for anyone running a large network.</p>
