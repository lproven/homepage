<hr>
<p>The Internet boom is over. It's all downhill from here, back into the 1970s-style morass of non-interoperable, 
proprietary systems with inflated pricetags - only this time, the software is the closed system.</p>
<p>Alright, I concede that this is a worst-case scenario - but we pessimists are never disappointed. The last year 
or two, I suspect, may one day be seen as the Web's halcyon Golden Age - the market had largely 
consolidated onto just two browsers, which would accurately and faithfully show 99% of each other's coding 
and formatting accurately. Although active content was commonplace, it was still possible to design and build a 
substantial and good-looking website single-handed using nothing more than a text editor and a paint package - 
although there was a plethora of smart platform-independent tools to automate the drudgery for you. Email 
meant ASCII with MIME attachments and there was a near-infinite variety of clients, many free. Usenet was 
still uncensored and usable with a few anti-spam precautions.</p>
<p>And now where are we going? The fourth revisions of the two major browsers are deliberately incompatible, 
use different dialects of HTML, and support different forms of active content. Microsoft has set itself against 
Java, removing it from its huge sprawling site, announcing that it will not support future versions of the JDK and 
pushing the Windows-only JDirect API instead, while weaving its own browser deep into its current OSs. Its 
server product only runs on NT and works best with Microsoft's own clients...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Netscape aims for a more &quot;open&quot; stance, but increasingly focuses its efforts on the business 
Intranet market, abandoning the home or SoHo arena to the increasingly inaccurately-named Microsoft. 
Netscape uses HTML for mail formatting, while Microsoft has its own system. Microsoft favours Dynamic 
HTML and Windows-only ActiveX, while Netscape ploughs on with Java and a mounting pile of extensions.<br>
When you buy Windows 98 or NT 5, Internet Explorer 4 will be right in there, complete with its patchy and 
inconsistent Web-desktop model; we can only hope that administrators will be able to turn most of it off. It's 
even in MacOS 8. Why pay for Netscape's client? So, Netscape will retreat back to its UNIX hardcore 
supporters, and the &quot;open systems&quot; world will take another step away from the Microsoft owned, run and 
controlled desktop.</p>
<p>Instead of desktops running a rich (if confusing and unmanageable) mixture of DOS, Windows, OS/2 and 
MacOS, backed up by Novell, Unix and LanMan, the &quot;safe choice&quot; becomes NT everywhere, probably 
running on Intel. The RISC vendors - Sun, Digital and Apple - become marginalised into a vocal but 
un-influential niche. Unix machines metamorphose imperceptibly into mainframes and bearded enthusiasts 
running homebrew public-domain versions on yet more Intel PCs.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Because while a decade ago no-one got fired for buying IBM, now the safe choice is 
Microsoft. More and more people have never used anything else. And Microsoft and Intel are committed to a 
sales model of limited lifespans, rapid depreciation and continuous upgradfes. Meanwhile the dream of an open, 
Internet-based future world of seamless interoperability just fades away...</p>
