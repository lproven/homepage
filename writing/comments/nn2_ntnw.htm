<p>There are a great many UNIX and NetWare users out there who are wondering what all the fuss about NT is - 
you may well be one of them. After all, it doesn&#146;t do anything that couldn&#146;t be done before. If all you need is a 
modest LAN server, the specs of an NT server next to a NetWare box are very high: lots of memory, a fast 
CPU, certified hardware, and so on, while for a dozen or two users, an old 486 with 16MB of RAM will make 
an acceptable NetWare server. Similarly, if you need a webserver and an Internet gateway, either a modest 
Sun or the same old 486 with Linux will do just fine.</p>
<p>The answer isn&#146;t marketing, either. Microsoft makes lots of noise about Windows 95 and Office, but NT 
doesn&#146;t get anything like the coverage. I think what it&#146;s really all about is simplicity. Anyone with a basic 
knowledge of Windows &#150; any Windows &#150; can get NT up and running. But it doesn&#146;t stop there. Once it&#146;s up, 
it&#146;s trivial to connect Windows clients up to it. No extra software, no client installs, nothing. If you want email, 
it&#146;s in the box. Webserver? Bundled too. Routed Internet connection? Yup.</p>
<p>Of course, the dream doesn&#146;t last. Soon, our novice NT admin is going to meet service packs, blue screens, 
and other absorbing pastimes&#133; but by then, they&#146;re committed.</p>
<p>Compare this with NetWare: NLMs, namespaces, internal network numbers, NDS trees, AUTOEXEC.NCF, 
global and user login scripts, Client32. The end result is leaner, meaner, and can run rings around NT as a 
server... but only if you know NetWare. Don&#146;t think that knowing NetWare 2 or 3 will be enough, either &#150; oh 
no, it&#146;s all changed since then. Any corporate with NetWare will have trained staff, sure, but every company 
has to start somewhere. Similar applies to Unix, whether on specialist hardware or a PC.</p>
<p>It&#146;s past time that Microsoft&#146;s competitors got their fingers out and addressed their enemy&#146;s strengths instead of 
its weaknesses. Novell: stop playing with NDS and logged file systems, and let&#146;s see an entry-level NetWare 
that talks NetBEUI, IP and Appletalk, supports SMB, AppleShare and NFS clients, that by default is a 
POP3-mail and web server as well as file and print, and that can be installed with one command from one CD 
by someone who doesn&#146;t know what words like &quot;file server&quot;, &quot;SCSI&quot; and &quot;NIC&quot; mean. Let&#146;s see the return of 
some of the things older versions of NetWare did: booting from its own partition and support for DOS sessions 
(a potentially invaluable aid to a stressed admin; do file management on the server!) Let&#146;s have support for 
non-NetWare partitions. Let&#146;s have on-the-fly volume repair and repartitioning. Let&#146;s have LanMan Domain 
support &#150; SCO can do it, why not you? Let&#146;s see the end of massive RAM requirements for big disks.</p>
<p>Let&#146;s see, above all else, something that&#146;s easier than Microsoft.</p>
