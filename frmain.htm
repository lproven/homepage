<p><font size="4">This page contains a selection of my published writing. Clicking on the
categories at the top displays a list of those pieces down the left hand side; click on
one of the titles to read the piece. Newer pieces appear at the top.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My &quot;Comment&quot; column appears once a month in Network News
magazine. This is a weekly title - other issues' columns are written by Jon Honeyball,
Steve Harrington and Davey Winder.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Stand-alone reviews cover both hardware and software: some are
head-to-head reviews covering two or more similar products.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grouptest reviews are comparative pieces which form part of a group test
or &quot;Labs&quot; article: an article comparing multiple similar products.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Features and box-outs are complete magazine features or parts thereof.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Finally come some book reviews, mainly of science fiction. These were
first published in <em>Vector</em>, the critical journal of the BSFA, or on <a
href="http://www.diversebooks.com">DiverseBooks.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.
