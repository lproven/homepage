<h1><font size=5>Epson GT-9000</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;759 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Epson 0800-220546</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Higher resolution and faster than the 8500, but the end 
result isn't greatly better quality.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>The final Epson this month is the high-end GT-9000. Slightly larger than the 
8500, this is an imposing creature, with a striking blue hinge mechanism to 
its lid, which even as a document pocket on top, a neat and friendly touch. 
Another neat detail unique to this model is a fold-out platform on the right 
hand side, for supporting wide originals. Around the back are a similar set of 
ports to the 8500; the 9000 can use the same sheetfeeder and transparency 
adaptor as the smaller model. With a true 600x600ppi optical resolution, 
this unit is moderately well suited to scanning transparencies - 300ppi 
scanners will only make a small, grainy image from a 35mm slide, whilst 
dedicated slide scanners run at thousands of ppi. The colour resolution is the 
same 30 bits as the 8500, however, and whilst it did slightly better in our 
colour accuracy test, results in this and the photo tests were disappointing. 
Epson seems to have optimised the scanner's performance, though, and it 
was measurably faster than the 8500.</p>
<p>Epson's high level of attention to details shows in all three machines. As well 
as power switches located conveniently at the front of the case, they all have 
reset buttons as well. These are seldom needed, but scanning large, 
high-resolution photos can generate huge image files which strain PCs to the 
limit. If your program crashes, it may be necessary to reset the scanner 
before trying again, and the Epsons make this easy. The same drivers are 
supplied as with the other two, and the same Adaptec card as with the 
8500, so the same comments apply.</p>
<p>The software bundle with all three scanners is impressive: image editing is 
provided by a full copy of Corel PhotoPaint 5. This is the latest 16-bit 
version of Corel's retouching package, and has an impressive range of 
features; it comes complete with the Mosaic add-in for image file 
management. An incongruous but pleasant extra is a CD containing the older 
CorelDRAW! 4 suite. Document image processing and OCR is provided 
by the Xerox Color [sic] Document Management package, including 
TextBridge OCR. This supplies tools for scanning, OCRing, filing, searching 
and sorting documents, but unfortunately, in our tests, the 16-bit version 
didn't function correctly under Windows 95, with TextBridge reporting that 
no scanner was installed; Windows 95 users might be better advised to 
upgrade to TextBridge Pro 96 (reviewed in PC Pro issue 23) or OmniPage 
Pro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our tests, the Epson didn't do as well as we expected. 
Although it's a reasonable and flexible machine, it doesn't offer enough 
benefits over the 8500 unless you really need the higher resolution.</p>
