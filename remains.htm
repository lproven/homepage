<p>Mortal Remains is a joyfully iconoclastic book. Occasionally, it defers to its 
elders, but more often, it cheerfully borrows their concepts and twists them 
'til breaking point.</p>
<p>At heart, it's a chase across the Solar System, but with many excursions to 
other places and events. The time in which it's set isn't explicitly given, 
although it's mentioned that no-one has landed on Earth for centuries. 
Virtually the entire System has been settled and terraformed, from the hot 
inner planets out to icy Pluto, yet in all this time, it seems that no-one has 
managed to travel to other stars &#150; or, at least, they haven't returned to tell 
the tale. This implicit acceptance of Einsteinian relativity seems to be a trend 
in some contemporary SF: since, given current knowledge, you can't go 
faster than light, if an author wishes to remain rigorous and not resort to 
magic, there can be no FTL, and therefore, no star travel. Presumably, 
slower-than-light travel via slow generation ships or immortal inorganic 
explorers, or travel by individuals thanks to time dilation, isn't good enough.</p>
<p>In any event, the people of the Solar System have used the long ages of their 
imprisonment well. High technology is everywhere, but here, rather than 
being indistinguishable from magic, it's hard to tell technology from biology. 
Most of the tools and machines of daily life, from houses to cars to 
spacecraft, are semi-sentient living creatures in their own right, and you must 
look hard to find inanimate mechanisms anywhere. Although they shun the 
Earth itself, there are people everywhere else, from the asteroids up to the 
moons of Jupiter, and everywhere there are living machines to keep the 
environmental conditions hospitable to normal, unmodified humans. At some 
point in history, from the time of the novel, there was a pogrom against the 
Augmenters, those humans that used biotechnology to mould their bodies to 
their environment, rather than the reverse. The &quot;standard&quot; humans won, and 
the remaining living Augmenters in the inner system were sent into exile on 
the Earth, whose wild and rampant artificially-tampered ecosystems are now 
the most dangerous place in the System. There are other renegade 
Augmenters still living in the outer reaches of the System, though, and 
reconciliation between them and the unaugmented is a major theme of the 
book.</p>
<p>The basic setup of an densely-populated System based around elaborate 
biotech, set some millennia hence, is strongly reminiscent of John C. 
McLoughlin's The Helix and the Sword [Futura, 1986], and the two share a 
theme in the reclamation and recolonisation of a long-shunned Earth which 
has now recovered from past ecological excesses. However, in Mortal 
Remains, there's a lot more going on. </p>
<p>The inhabitants of the System don't refer to it as such; to them, it is the 
No&ouml;space, the physical volume occupied by the No&ouml;sphere, Teilhard de 
Chardin's realm or domain of the mind. In a bold gesture towards 
conventional religion, Evans' humanity has abandoned the uncertain 
redemption of a immanent deity in favour of creating their own technological 
transcendence. Technology has banished old age and death; instead, at the 
end of an individual's appointed period, their mind is translated into the 
noosphere, apparently a gigantic computer which stores the myriad past 
lives: an intriguing take on the current idea of immortality through 
resurrection in a computer. The living can visit their dead ancestors by 
entering a shrine, which puts them in communication with those in the 
noosphere. This is the main way that this vast community keeps a sense of 
identity and cohesion, and allows the staff of the noosphere &#150; the closest 
analogue to a government &#150; to keep track of their charges. The nominal 
leaders of the no&ouml;space are the two Advocates, but the current incumbents 
seem to be neglecting their duties, and plans are afoot to replace.</p>
<p>This gives a partial insight into the remarkably dense and complex universe 
of the novel, as conveyed through the viewpoints of its multiple first- and 
third-person narrators. Few novels contain such richness of setting; Dan 
Simmon's Hyperion is one of the most recent examples that spring to mind. 
There's a lot of ambiguity here also, some intentional, some (I would guess) 
not &#150; for instance, it's hard to keep the noosphere and no&ouml;space separate 
and distinct in one's mind. More deliberate is the ambiguity of narrator, 
observer and participant. Different scenes are recounted as seen by different 
people, with occasional, disconnected first-person interludes. Gradually, the 
two converge. It's a very effective structure, and since one side clearly 
dominates, it's less hard work than, say, the alternating storylines of Iain M. 
Banks' Use of Weapons.</p>
<p>Mortal Remains is a complex, deep and fulfilling novel, bursting with ideas, 
woven through with a compelling plot. It's also great fun.</p>
