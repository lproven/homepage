          Although my BSc is in Biology, I found that people will pay me
          much more<br>
          to play with computers all day. Other interests include
          reading - mainly<br>
          science fiction, bikes (with and without engines), music (all
          sorts with<br>
          the exception of folk and country; I also make appalling
          noises with the<br>
          didgeridu and mouthorgan), languages and linguistics (dabble
          in French -<br>
          struggle in German and Spanish - can make polite noises in
          Norwegian and<br>
          Swedish), travel (mainly Europe and Africa so far).<br>
          <br>
          I was born in Ormskirk, just outside Liverpool - born
          Lancastrian, but a<br>
          Liverpudlian by early upbringing. I left with all possible
          speed - first <br>
          to Nigeria for about 8 years, then a brief spell in Southport,
          thence to <br>
          the Isle of Man for ten years, three of these studying at
          Royal Holloway<br>
          and Bedford New College, University of London, in Egham,
          Surrey.<br>
          <br>
          Professionally, I do consultancy and technical support on
          computers - by<br>
          which I mean that I recommend or specify, install, configure,
          customise,<br>
          train and support both standalone and network systems.<br>
          <br>
          I am platform-agnostic. I mainly work with Windows (all
          versions) on PCs<br>
          but I also do Macintosh and Linux and a host of obsolete
          systems. <br>
          <br>
          Alas, I'm a lousy programmer, but I fiddle fractals,
          artificial life and<br>
          suchlike. A long time ago I did fractal generators for various
          computers<br>
          under the name “Heathercliffe Software” but I gave up when
          FractInt came <br>
          out. A current low-priority background task is rewriting the
          HS suite of<br>
          programs as a Win32 screensaver in VB. If this interests you,
          please let<br>
          me know!<br>
          <br>
          I also work as a freelance computer journalist. I've been
          published in a<br>
          variety of titles, including PC Pro, Network News, PC
          Magazine, MacUser, <br>
          PCW, PC Advisor, and Vector (the magazine of the British
          Science Fiction <br>
          Association - http://www.bsfa.co.uk). My specialities are
          networks (LANs<br>
          to the Internet) and operating systems, but I'll take any job
          with money <br>
          at the end. Reviews and feature work are always welcome - and
          I can work<br>
          to very short deadlines if necessary! :¬)<br>
          <br>
          In connection with this, I also do talks, to live audiences
          and a little<br>
          radio work.<br>
          <br>
          Personally, I'm a tall, dark figure given to lurking in the
          dark corners<br>
          of nightclubs, loud concerts by little-known bands, SF
          conventions, real<br>
          ale festivals, and custom bike shows. I seem to get regularly
          accused of<br>
          being a Goth - except by Goths.<br>
          <br>
          I am also a biker. Until the 27th of May 1994, I rode a
          beautiful Kwack:<br>
          a de-restricted Kawasaki ZZR1100-C1 (with a custom paintjob in
          the style<br>
          of a GSX-R1100). On my way up to Norwich for the bank holiday
          weekend, I <br>
          was knocked off it by a coach while overtaking a traffic jam.
          The driver<br>
          (one Mr Thomas Rigg) was prosecuted for careless driving and
          fined £200, <br>
          which doesn't make up for the two months I spent in hospital
          with a left <br>
          leg broken at the ankle (3×), tibia (2×), fibula (2×), femur
          (multiple),<br>
          hip, right humerus (shoulder joint detached), left shoulder
          (dislocated)<br>
          and inner-ear damage from whiplash.<br>
          <br>
          I am now held together by quite a lot of surgical steel rods
          and screws, <br>
          and glad (as well as EXTREMELY lucky) to be alive at all.<br>
          <br>
          It was all going so well, too. Good job, loads of money, two
          girlfriends<br>
          - Danie in Norwich and Kim in London - bike of my dreams, a
          fun place to <br>
          live. 3 months later, no girlfriends, no bike, semi-crippled,
          and living<br>
          alone. C'est la vie. It's better now. Not quite that good,
          granted, but…<br>
          <br>
          The ZZR still exists; it's being rebuilt as a three-wheeler by
          <a href="http://www.trikeshop.co.uk">The Trike<br>
            Shop</a> in Cardiff (it should resemble the big Hayabusa,
          but in purple.)<br>
          <br>
          I also ride a Linear recumbent bicycle: a 2m beam with a
          little wheel on<br>
          the front and a big one at the back, with me lying on top.
          This has been<br>
          clocked at a smidge over 40mph on the flat and 70mpg downhill.<br>
          <br>
          Other pleasures:<br>
          <br>
          - books: SF, but not fantasy, from Jack Vance to Terry
          Pratchett,<br>
          &nbsp; especially “hard” SF and golden-age stuff from the '50s
          &amp; '60s <br>
          - Bikes [pedal or engine-powered, the stranger it is the
          better]<br>
          - Music [anything except English &amp; American folk.]<br>
          &nbsp; Recent purchases:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blur, '13'<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Radiohead, 'OK Computer'<br>
          - Black clothing, ever since my father died. But it looks
          better,<br>
          too.<br>
          - being alive and able-bodied... so far...<br>
          <br>
          Dislikes:<br>
          - eating meat [20 years a veggie];<br>
          - four-wheel vehicles and bad drivers thereof [for reasons
          which,<br>
          I trust, are obvious]<br>
          - non-rationalism. [I am a skeptic. If you can't prove it,
          then I<br>
          &nbsp; don't believe it. I comoderate the AOL area for the UK
          magazine<br>
          &nbsp; “The Skeptic” and have appeared on BBC TV's Kilroy
          twice]<br>
          - arguing [goes with the skepticism]<br>
          - religion [see above]<br>
          - war and warfare<br>
          - ignorance, superstition and stupidity<br>
          <br>
          Computers:<br>
          <br>
          - two <a href="http://www.meshcomputers.com">Mesh</a> PCs: a
          PII-450 and a Cyrix P200+;<br>
          - an NT Server, an IBM PC/2 Model 80-A31;<br>
          - a Sun SPARCstation IPC;<br>
          - an Apple Macintosh Performa 5200CD;<br>
          - two Psions, a 16MB 5mx and a 512K 3a;<br>
          - two Apple Newtons, an OMP and a 2100;<br>
          - an Amiga 1200;<br>
          - a Mega2 ST;<br>
          - a Sinclair QL;<br>
          - an original Sinclair 128K Spectrum with a pair of 5.25"
          floppy<br>
          &nbsp; drives and one of only 200-odd numeric keypads ever
          made.<br>
          You can take it as read that they've all been heavily
          upgraded.<br>
          <br>
          Other hardware:<br>
