<hr>
<p>If you are thinking about buying a Pentium Pro system, then you are 
probably considering running Windows NT. Current versions of the Pentium 
Pro processor only give their best running 32-bit code, and as much of 
Windows 95 is still 16-bit, it doesn&#146;t use Pentium Pros to their best 
advantage.</p>
<p>But what is different about NT?</p>
<p>Looking at the current versions, Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and 
Windows 95 4.1 (or &quot;OSR2&quot;), cosmetically, there&#146;s little difference. Both 
use the new Explorer interface, with a Start menu and cascading folders. 
32-bit applications will run on both, as long as they don&#146;t use device drivers 
or VxDs &#150; NT won&#146;t run device drivers from any previous version of DOS 
of Windows, so it pays to choose your hardware carefully, selecting only 
items with NT drivers. Even common devices like the SoundBlaster 
AWE32 P&amp;P aren&#146;t supported as standard. NT also doesn&#146;t currently 
support several other 95 niceties: there&#146;s no plug&amp;play, no power 
management, no DirectX, no dynamic insertion or removal of PCMCIA 
cards, no MS-DOS mode for running awkward DOS software. Finally, 
there&#146;s no way to upgrade a Windows 95 system to NT: you have to start 
over and reinstall all your software.</p>
<p>So, if so much is missing, what is there that&#146;s worth having? Well, NT is a 
totally new 32-bit system, rather than an enhancement of a 16-bit system 
running on top of DOS. It&#146;s much more stable than 95 under stress, handles 
multiple processors and vast amounts of memory with ease and multitasks 
smoothly even when working flat-out. It has better memory-management 
than 95 and previous versions: even old 16-bit programs run better, with no 
resource restrictions. For working with huge files, you can spread the 
system&#146;s virtual memory over multiple paging files, improving performance. 
It has a better disk format which is highly resistant to corruption, and it 
supports basic software RAID &#150; you can format several disks into one big 
volume, or mirror a vital volume onto two drives.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits are also true of other systems, such as OS/2 and 
UNIX, but the great advantages of NT are its familiarity to a Windows user 
and that it will run most Windows applications.</p>
<p>The Pentium Pro, though, only gives its best with 32-bit code. Although the 
current PC Pro benchmarks use mainly 16-bit applications, the 16-bit code 
in Windows 95 itself slows the Pentium Pro machines down. In our tests on 
the Armari machine, the fastest in this Labs, NT 3.51 was some 10% faster 
than Windows 95, whilst NT 4 was a couple of percent slower than 95. 
With all 32-bit apps, both versions of NT would perform better.</p>
