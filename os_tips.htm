<h1><font size=4>PC Pro's Top Ten Tips when choosing an operating 
system</font></h1>
<hr>
<p>There are many reasons for choosing an operating system (OS), and which 
criteria are most important are ultimately down to personal taste. There are 
some things, though, that everybody should consider - the following are 
some that you might want to consider before choosing a system on which to 
run your business.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Applications</font></h2>
<p>This isn't really open to debate. Before you choose a computer, or OS, you 
should decide for what you're going to use it and what applications software 
you'll need for that job. Choose the apps you need, then choose something 
that will run them well - stably, quickly and easily.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Compatibility</font></h2>
<p>This is the most difficult, and most people will have to compromise. If you 
already have hardware and software you wish to keep then you'll want an 
OS that will run with them. You will almost certainly need new device 
drivers for all your various peripherals, so try to ensure that these exist, and 
that your software either runs under the new system or has a version that 
will. If you're considering upgrading your hardware, either by adding 
memory or storage or by replacing it altogether, this might be the best time - 
check the hardware requirements of the new OS, and make sure your 
equipment meets them.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Support</font></h2>
<p>This means different things to different people. You will probably want to 
know that you can get help from somewhere, so check out that your dealers 
know the product - or change to ones who do. If the manufacturer does 
direct support, then any really difficult problems will get referred back to 
them, so how well they can support it is important. Investigate how 
widely-used the system is - if it's any good, you should be able to find users 
who will give you an informed opinion. If it's unsuccessful, it may not stay on 
the market, and you'll be wasting time and effort moving to it.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Usability</font></h2>
<p>This is very important to some, and trivial to others, but try before you buy - 
apart from Windows 3.x, most OS's user-interfaces can only be 
customised, not completely replaced, so you should be able to get along 
with it. If you're already used to PCs, you might prefer a system that works 
the way you do, rather than forcing you to suddenly change. Don't forget 
that user-friendliness also extends to configuring the machine, coping with 
errors and so on, not just manipulating files and programs - try to break it 
and see what happens!</p>
<h2><font size=3>Cost</font></h2>
<p>Last on the list comes cost. Mistakes now will cost much more later, so it 
pays to choose carefully. In addition to paying for the OS itself, you must 
allow for the likelihood of more memory, more disk space, and new 
applications - plus the lost time while you upgrade and get used to the new 
system.</p>
