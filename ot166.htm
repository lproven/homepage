<hr>
<p>At first glance, inside and out, the resemblance between
Office Techniques T166+ and West One&#146;s Vivace is striking.
Both use the same screwless minitower case, Cyrix 6x86 CPUs on
Tyan motherboards, Quantum Fireball 1280 hard disks and STB
Lightspeed 128 graphics cards. However, there are several
differences; the T166+ is built around the Triton VX chipset,
rather than the HX, and has two DIMM banks for SDRAM modules.
This is still scarce, though, so Office Techniques supplied the
machine EDO SIMMs instead. In tests, the performance gains from
SDRAM are negligible anyway - see the boxout on p<b><i><u>XXX</u></i></b>.</p>
<p>The VX Tyan has one less ISA slot than the HX version, and
Office Techniques has used the spare opening in the backplane to
mount a PS/2 mouse port. Whilst it&#146;s good to see PS/2 mice,
we prefer all the ports in case cutouts. Other minor flaws are
the location of the hard disk and some of the cables that make
working in the machine more awkward. To keep the drive cables
tidy, they&#146;re held in place with a metal clip that&#146;s
stuck onto the bottom of the hard disk, right on one of the drive
controller chips. This brings the metal perilously close to the
legs of the chips, where it could potentially cause a
short-circuit that could damage the machine, though this is
pretty unlikely. A neat touch is the extra-long CD audio lead
that&#146;s routed right around the edge of the case, rather than
straight across the motherboard like most of the other systems.</p>
<p>The sound card is a full SoundBlaster AWE32, with all the
optional software installed, including Creative Labs&#146;
impressive new Windows 95 drivers. The IDE port can&#146;t be
disabled, but it&#146;s been reconfigured to IRQ 10 so as not to
conflict with the onboard EIDE, and the controller is labelled as
&quot;Creative Labs IDE&quot; in the control panel - neat. We
also liked the small supporting brace stuck onto the case that
holds the end of the &#190; length card firmly. It drives a pair
of Soundwave 240 speakers, which have a good, solid sound, but
not as impressive as Yamaha&#146;s. The only other card is the
STB Lightspeed, based on Tseng Labs&#146; 128-bit ET6000 chip.
It&#146;s a fast card, but lacks 3D acceleration. The clear,
steady display is a Samsung SyncMaster 15Gli.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a competent, well-built machine, with a range
of good, solid parts. However, no great effort has been lavished
upon the software setup aside from installing the necessary
device drivers - no Triton 2 or busmastering EIDE drivers, no
extras or preinstalled software. There&#146;s nothing major wrong
with it, but there&#146;s little to especially commend it,
either.</p>
