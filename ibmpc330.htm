<hr>
<p>IBM has undergone many changes in recent years, and today, the
PC Company is quite a different creature from what it once was.
Although it&#146;s not in the business of producing cheap,
low-end machines, current models follow industry trends: this
machine eschews OS/2 for Windows 95, is based around the latest
Intel Triton HX chipset, and even has an Intel processor, despite
the fact that the popular Cyrix 6x86 is actually mad in IBM
Microelectronics&#146; fabs.</p>
<p>Debates about AT versus ATX motherboards are irrelevant here:
the machine uses an IBM designed and built board. It&#146;s big,
larger than A4, with 3 shared PCI/ISA expansion slots on a riser
card. In this low-profile desktop case the machine can only take
3 cards; larger cases are available. As the motherboard has an
embedded S3 Trio64V+, all the slots are free in a basic
configuration. The motherboard is very neat, with the CPU and
CELP modules at the front, out of expansion cards&#146; way. The
RAM sockets include a DIMM socket, rare on a Triton HX machine.
All the ports are mounted directly on the rear edge of the board,
reducing cable clutter, and the drive cable connectors are right
by the drives, so the cables don&#146;t intrude, although that
area is cramped to work in.</p>
<p>Along the back of the case are all the usual connectors.
There&#146;s only one serial port, but there&#146;s an infra-red
COM2 port with the correct drivers pre-installed. Another new
feature is a pair of USB ports, but we were unable to test them
as there are no USB devices or drivers yet. This is the first
system PC Pro has seen with USB, and shows that IBM can still be
innovative.</p>
<p>Preloaded software is impressive: the IBM Welcome Centre
explains the basics for beginners, remote support via CoSession
remote-control software, Intel ProShare videoconferencing,
IBM&#146;s own anti-virus package, and the NetFinity system
management software. Lotus SmartSuite would normally be present,
too. IBM include disk images of all necessary drivers, including
EIDE bus-mastering. </p>
<p>Our machine has no multimedia features, which are normally
left up to the dealer&#146;s discretion, as would be the monitor
- although there are ports for a microphone and speakers, which
implies that onboard sound is an option. For the purposes of
review, IBM supplied us with an IBM P70 17in monitor, which has a
first-class FST Trinitron screen. The PS/2 mouse and keyboard are
both IBM own-brand; the mouse is a pleasantly symmetrical
two-button unit, and the keyboard is a usable lightweight unit -
unfortunately not the justly-famous PS/2 Extended keyboard.</p>
<p>It&#146;s hard to directly compare the PC330 P166 with the
other machines in this Labs, as it&#146;s far more of a corporate
workhorse than the others, lacking multimedia bells and whistles.
It&#146;s a well-designed and built machine with no significant
flaws or problems, but its performance was lacklustre, probably
due to its Western Digital 1.6Gb hard disk, the same as in the
similarly-disappointing Dell. The three-year warranty is good,
too. However, there&#146;s still a massive price premium to pay:
a similar specification to the other machines would cost over
&#163;2,000.</p>
