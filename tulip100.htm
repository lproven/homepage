<h1><font size=5>Tulip Vision Line de 5/100</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;1,934 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Tulip Computer 01293-420200</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Beautifully designed and assembled, with a generous 
warranty, but it's slow and overpriced.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Tulip is one of the few remaining PC manufacturers who design and build its 
machines from the ground up: apart from its drives, virtually everything about 
machine is designed in-house. The de 5/100 is one of its corporate LAN 
workstations, and comes complete with a PCI Ethernet adapter integrated 
into the motherboard.</p>
<p>Externally, it's a neat desktop unit. The case is actually slightly narrower than 
the monitor, so it occupies a minimum of desk space. The lid is held on by a 
single screw at the back, but there's also a retaining clip and a case lock on 
the front panel, so this can be dispensed with. Inside, the machine is 
exceptionally neat and tidy. The motherboard is based around an Opti Viper 
chipset, which is perfectly functional but not as fast as Intel's Triton 
equivalent. However, the Opti chipset can handle parity-checked memory, 
which Triton cannot. Also on the motherboard, along with the normal EIDE, 
serial and parallel ports, are a Cirrus Logic GD5434 graphics and AMD 
PCnet Ethernet controller chips, so in its standard configuration, the machine 
has no add-in cards at all. There's also space on the motherboard for Tulip 
to add a daughterboard with a sound chip, and holes for speaker and 
microphone ports in the back of the case. There's no connector, though; the 
user can't do it. All parts of the PC are readily accessible, making it easy to 
work on and maintain. Integrated motherboards are more reliable than 
multiple separate boards - but , if anything fails, the whole board must be 
replaced. </p>
<p>One unusual feature was that the CD-ROM drive was connected to the 
same channel as the hard disk, the other channel being unused. This is fine 
under Windows 95, but would destroy the performance of a Windows 3.x 
system. To change it would mean obtaining a second drive cable, which 
wasn't supplied. - To add insult to injury, no documentation or disks were 
supplied with the machine at all. There is a directory on the hard disk 
containing a selection of device drivers and utilities, but sadly these are for 
MS-DOS and Windows 3, and are no use with Windows 95. Without 
them, we were unable to set the refresh rate of the monitor, limiting the 
display to 800x600, rather than its true maximum of 1024x768. We used 
the refresh-rate utility from the PC Pro cover CD to set-up the machine for 
testing. </p>
<p>The quality of the components is good; the Tulip keyboard has a good, firm 
feel, and the Tulip mouse is a comfortable symmetrical shape. The 15in 
screen is fairly sharp, but is beaten by some of the others on test. However, 
the machine's performance is poor: it's the third slowest on test, nearly 30% 
slower than the best. The three slowest PCs all use non-Triton chipsets, 
which clearly shows the speed penalty involved. As this is also the most 
expensive machine on test, even its excellent build quality and three-year 
warranty don't really make up for its sloth.</p>
