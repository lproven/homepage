<title>FAT cluster sizes</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>Microsoft's FAT (File Allocation Table) disk format uses fixed cluster sizes
depending on the size of the partition. This three charts on this page contain
the sizes of cluster for different sizes of drive.</p>
<p>The original FAT format is used from MS-DOS 2.0 onwards, and is also
supported in OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Linux, BeOS and most PC operating
systems, as well as non-PC operating systems such as Apple MacOS, Atari GEM,
AmigaOS, RISC OS and others. It's the closest thing to a universally understood
disk format there is.</p>
<p>There are several extensions to FAT. One is Microsoft's VFAT, introduced in
Windows 95, which uses additional directory entries to store long file names and
additional attributes. Others are Linux's UMSDOS, which stores similar
information along with Unix-style access permissions and file types in an
additional &quot;--LINUX-.---&quot; file in each directory, and OS/2's system of
&quot;extended attributes.&quot; These do not, however, change the basic
filesystem structure. The Atari ST's TOS, based on Digital Research CP/M-68K,
uses a different ID type but the same basic FAT structure.</p>
<h3>FAT12</h3>
<p>This can reasonably be called obscure these days. It is only used on
partitions up to 16MB in size.</p>

<h3>FAT16</h3>
<p>Up until MS-DOS 3.3, the maximum allowed size for a partition was 32MB. This
limit was broken by several proprietary utilities (such as Ontrack Disk Manager
and Golden Bow's V-Feature Deluxe) and OEM versions of DOS, but the variant used
in Compaq DOS 3.31 was the one adopted as standard in IBM's PC DOS 4 and all
later versions of MS-DOS.</p>
<p>Some recent versions of DOS use 2K clusters for all FAT16 partitions up to
127MB.</p>

<h3>FAT32</h3>
<p>Introduced with Windows 95B (also known as OSR2), FAT32 was developed to
overcome the inefficiency of FAT16 on partitions larger than half a gigabyte, as
well as to allow drives of over 2GB to be formatted as a single partition.</p>
<p>It is also supported under Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows 2000.</p>
<p>As it is intended to support larger volumes, sizes are quoted in Gigabytes,
not Megabytes as in the above two tables.</p>
