<h2><a name="sec1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>To defend itself against the US Department of Justice's charges of unfair trading
leading to a monopoly, Microsoft Corporation, the wealthiest company in the USA, has cited
a free, cooperatively developed operating system as evidence that it faces real
competition.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>The OS in question is, of course, Linux, a form of Unix developed in 1991 by a
student in his spare time. Yet this is the <i>only </i>non-Windows OS in the world
currently gaining market share. It may only be doing so well <i>because</i> it's free, but
its future looks bright. It needs no financial justification for its continued
development, and the continuing growth of the PC industry favours it as much as Microsoft.
It's especially strong in non-English speaking countries; created by a Swedish-speaking
Finn, and with all the source code readily available, it internationalises well.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>The aim of this article is to help you to install a a working Linux system, get
it running properly, connected to a network and the Internet, and performing useful work.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Linux is a form of Unix, which has its own names and concepts which long predate
the PC, DOS and Windows. While I've tried to avoid too much specialist terminology, some
is inevitable, which I'll explain as we go. </p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="sec2">What <u>is</u> Linux?</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></h2>

<p></font>The operating system called &quot;Linux&quot; is actually a blend of the Linux
kernel, tools from Richard Stallman's GNU project and various other components.</p>
<i>

<p>The kernel and GNU</i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>The kernel is the heart of the system, and as well as managing processes, memory
  and I/O, it contains all the main hardware device drivers. Next comes a layer of programs
  which provide network services, the command-line interface (or <i>shell</i>) and so on,
  many of which come from GNU. Many are &quot;daemons&quot;, running in the background and
  never directly interacting with the user. Their names often end in a &quot;d&quot; to make
  this apparent - e.g., pppd, the point-to-point protocol daemon, which makes an Internet
  connection over a modem.<font FACE="Courier New"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><i>

<p>The X window system</i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>The next layer comprises the services which provide a graphical user interface.
  Unix graphics work via a tremendously powerful and flexible protocol called X. It can
  function over a network, so that a program and its display can be on separate machines;
  however, for a Linux machine running standalone or on a Windows network, this is academic.<font
  FACE="Courier New"></p>
  <p></font>Linux graphics are provided by a program called an X server -usually XFree86,
  although commercial alternatives such as MetroLink's Metro-X exist. This offers features
  such as a multiple monitor and OpenGL support, neither of which XFree86 does - yet. The
  current XFree86 at the time of writing is v3.3.1, and keeping it up to date is necessary
  to support the latest graphics adaptors. 3D acceleration is possible through a separate
  program, Mesa, although at present only on 3DFX.<font FACE="Courier New"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><i>

<p>The window manager</i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>X simply displays graphics, it doesn't provide paraphernalia such as ways to
  move and size windows. This is the job of a separate program called a <i>window manager</i>.
  Traditional window managers do little else, perhaps adding an application menu. As purists
  regard anything more as frippery, such programs are found in most Linux distributions,
  including:<ul>
    <li>fvwm, a basic window manager with support for virtual desktops. [<a
      href="images/Fvwm.jpg">screenshot</a>]</li>
    <li>fvwm95, which adds a superficial Windows 95 look and feel, complete with taskbar and
      Start menu.</li>
    <li>AfterStep, which emulates the look and feel of the NextStep operating system, with
      attractively-shaded title bars and menus, plus an icon bar.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you're coming over from another GUI such as Windows, though, these will rudimentary
  and unfriendly. Consequently, there's a trend towards more elaborate, complete user
  interfaces. Today, the most powerful is the <i>K Desktop Environment </i>or KDE, a
  complete GUI including a file manager, application menu, iconic desktop, task bar and a
  host of utilities from a text editor to a tool to make Internet connections. [<a
  href="images/kde_tools.jpg">screenshot</a>] Some people dislike KDE for its somewhat
  Windows-like look and feel, but if Windows is where your experience lies, this is just
  what you need!<font FACE="Courier New"></p>
</blockquote>

<p></font>The main practical consequence of Linux' piecemeal construction is the need to
keep track of the different components, for instance to update them to support the latest
hardware, or for greater system stability. As the Linux kernel actually contains most
device drivers, it's one to watch, as are XFree86 and your chosen desktop environment. </p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Unlike Microsoft's marketing-created version numbers, Linux version numbers mean
something. Take the current Linux kernel - at the time of writing, version 2.2.1. The
first number is the major version, and seldom changes. The second part is the minor
version, and changes more often. Finally comes the revision level, which can change every
few months.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Odd-numbered minor versions are development kernels, which are essentially beta
code and should be avoided. Even-numbered minor versions denote stable code. For some
years, the stable kernel was version 2.0.<i>n</i>, which got to revision 36. This or
2.0.35 is still found in most shipping distributions, as 2.2.1 is so new. By the time you
read this, 2.2.x kernels should be commonplace, with improved SMP performance and RAID
support amongst many other advances.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Concurrently, there were some 130 revisions of the 2.1.<i>n</i> family of
development kernels, which became stable version 2.2.0 at the start of January 1999 (Unix
counting usually starts from 0, not 1). So far, there's been one bug-fix release, thus the
current 2.2.1. The next development family will be 2.3.<i>n</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>

<h2><a name="sec3">Distributions</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></h2>

<p></font>With the parts of a Linux system being written by many different people or
groups, assembling a complete system is a complex undertaking. This was the reason for the
creation of Linux distributions: a person or company assembles their chosen assortment
from various different sources, tying them together with an installation program,
configuration files and documentation.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Although there is a profusion of different distributions, they're starting to
converge as certain tools achieve dominance. Important differences remain, and each has
unique points of interest, but for the most readily-available assistance and software
support it's probably best to go with one of the bigger &quot;mainstream&quot;
distributions. The following are the main competitors.</p>
<i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>The most widely-used distribution; even Linux Torvalds himself runs Red Hat. The
  biggest name in Linux, the eponymous company has received investments from Netscape and
  Intel amongst others, leading to concern that Red Hat is becoming &quot;the Microsoft of
  Linux&quot;. The company has its own development labs, RHAD, whose output is donated back
  to the Linux community, including the most widely used software installation system, the
  RedHat Package Manager (rpm). It is also assisting development of the unfinished GNOME
  user interface. However, the company will not include any proprietary software, so, for
  instance, although KDE is open source, it uses a toolkit that wasn't, so Red Hat refuse to
  incorporate it.<font FACE="Courier New"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.caldera.com">Caldera</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>Backed by former Novell CEO Ray Noorda, Caldera now owns some former Novell and
  Digital Research technologies such as DR-DOS and GEM. It's also the main focus of
  Netware-Linux integration, having donated code to the Linux IPX stack, as well as offering
  a commercial NDS client and NDS-capable Netware server for Linux. Caldera's distribution
  is aimed at corporate users and includes commercial elements, so isn't freely
  distributable, but there's a &quot;Lite&quot; version that is.<font FACE="Courier New"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.suse.de">SuSE</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>This German distribution is quickly becoming the most popular in Europe. It's
  technically advanced, but the English-language version tends to lag behind the German one
  and it's not as well known or supported by American vendors.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>Maintained by Patrick Volkerding, Slackware is one of the oldest distributions,
  and as such, is the only one that can be installed from floppy disks as opposed to CD or
  over a network. Its age shows in some ways, such as differently-structured configuration
  files, but this can make it easier to find your way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>This is a non-commercial distribution produced by a non-profit making collective
  and comprises mainly GNU software; for instance, it eschews the rpm installation format
  for its own package system. There's also an experimental version based around the GNU HURD
  kernel. Probably the least user-friendly Linux, it's best avoided except by experts.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>

<p><a href="http://www.eit.de">EasyLinux</a></b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>A promising newcomer, this German distribution aims to be the beginners' Linux.
  Installation is completely graphical, the system boots to a GUI and runs the KDE
  throughout. At the time of writing, it's still in beta testing, but has great potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<i><b>

<p>Others</b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>There are many other distributions, including ones for Macintosh, Amiga, Atari
  ST, Acorn and most RISC workstations. Some you may encounter include:<ul>
    <li>Mandrake, a version of Red Hat with integrated KDE.</li>
    <li>Extreme Linux, another Red Hat variant designed for distributed massively-parallel
      computing, such as &quot;Beowulf&quot; clusters.</li>
    <li>TurboLinux (Japanese), LST and DLD (German), Unifix (POSIX-certified), Yggdrasil (now
      &quot;Plug and Play Linux&quot;). <font FACE="Courier New"></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
</font><i><b>

<p>xBSD</b></i><font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p></font>Another family of open source operating systems, differing from Linux mainly in
  that they use kernels based on the version of Unix developed at the University of
  California at Berkeley - the <i>Berkeley System Distribution</i>; examples include NetBSD,
  FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Their programming teams are closed, whereas anyone who wishes can get
  involved in working on the Linux kernel - if they're good enough! This has led to
  considerably more interest in Linux - but the BSD derivatives lead in some areas, for
  example networking, and are especially well suited to firewalls, web servers and so on,
  while Linux is equally a desktop client system.<font FACE="Courier New"></p>

<h2><a name="sec5">Set-up</a></b></h2>

<p>The easiest and safest way to experiment with Linux is using a dedicated PC. An old
machine will do: for modest graphical use, a 486DX2 with 16MB RAM and a 500MB drive will
suffice, while a Pentium/90 or faster with 24MB and 1GB and a CD-ROM will be ideal. Such a
system can be purchased second-hand for around the same price as a large additional disk
to hold Linux on your main machine.</p>

<p>If you can't afford a separate computer, some caveats apply: 

<ul>
  <li>If things go badly wrong during installation, you could lose everything on your PC. Be
    prepared and back up! <b>As an absolute minimum </b>ensure that you have copies of your
    main data files and installation disks to reload all important software. Two verified
    backups are best.</li>
  <li>Make a DOS boot diskette with working CD-ROM drivers, in case you need to re-install. If
    the thought of finding and adding these to your startup files is intimidating, you're not
    ready for Linux!</li>
  <li>Consider using a dedicated hard disk just for Linux.</li>
  <li>Don't try to install onto a machine that only runs Windows NT; it's much more
    complicated.</li>
  <li>Some modern hardware isn't supported under Linux yet, including DVD drives and USB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you start installing anything, make an inventory of your hardware - Windows 9x
can provide the details. The installation program will be asking questions later!</p>

<p>You need to know in advance about any devices you want to use under Linux; by the time
the installer asks, it's too late to go back and look. Furthermore, Linux doesn't properly
support plug and play, so unless you have hardware that absolutely requires it you should
disable P&amp;P in the BIOS, then ensure that everything still works under Windows. The
kernel's autoprobing device search often fails, even when devices are using their default
settings, so it'll help to know.</p>

<p>Get as much information on each device as possible, even if, with luck, you'll never
need it. </p>

<p>The basics are make, model and chipset. Generally, even brand-name devices use generic
third-party chipsets, and Linux will identify them by chipset, not manufacturer's model
name: for example, &quot;3c509&quot;, not 3Com Etherlink III; &quot;S3 Trio64V+&quot;, not
&quot;STB Powergraph 64&quot;, and so forth. For all controller cards, such as sound, SCSI
and network adaptors, you should know the settings: IRQ line, I/O port, DMA channel and
ROM address. (Not all devices use the last two, but almost everything uses the first
pair.) You should know whether all disk drives are IDE or SCSI; if IDE, whether master or
slave, and on primary or secondary channel; if SCSI, the unit number.</p>

<p>Here's a checklist to start from. 

<ul type="circle">
  <li>Hard disk(s): how many; size in MB; number of heads, cylinders and sectors per track;
    current partitions and filesystems (FAT16, FAT32, FAT32X or NTFS).<br>
    Disks aren't identified by letters, but as /dev/hd... (for IDE drives) or /dev/sd... (for
    SCSI ones). Next comes a letter determining the drive number: /dev/hda is the first IDE
    drive, for instance, while /dev/sdb is the second SCSI one. Following this is a number
    identifying the partition. Primary partitions are 1 to 4, an extended partition is 5, and
    logical drives in the extended partition are 6 up.</li>
  <li>CD-ROM drive: ATAPI (EIDE-interface) CDs are named as for hard disks, so a secondary
    master would be /dev/hdc. SCSI CDs are generally /dev/scd0. If an ATAPI CD is the only
    device on its channel, ensure it's the master.</li>
  <li>Graphics adaptor: amount of video RAM, supported modes with pixel resolutions, colour
    depth and refresh rates.</li>
  <li>Monitor: supported resolutions and <i>both </i>horizontal and vertical scan rates.</li>
  <li>Sound card: compatibility (for example, SoundBlaster 16, Pro orAWE32.) Linux support for
    SB-compatibles isn't very good, so if there's another mode, such as Windows Sound System
    compatibility, this may work better - but its settings will be different!</li>
  <li>SCSI adaptor: this may include parallel-port and floppy-interface drives such as Zip
    disks and tape drives.</li>
  <li>Network card: type of cabling, IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other devices will be easier to add later, but beware that many PC peripherals are only
really intended for use with DOS and Win9x, so are unlikely ever to work, or at least work
well, with Linux - and configuring them will be difficult. This includes Windows modems,
GDI printers, and many parallel port devices other than printers. Also, Postscript
printers are by far the easiest to set up, and other types require considerable additional
work.</p>

<p><b>Partitioning</b></p>

<p>This is an area that often causes problems. Recent machines usually have a single
primary FAT32 partition occupying the entire disk. To fit Linux onto the same drive, you
must replace the single Windows partition with several smaller partitions: one for
Windows, at least one for Linux, and a Linux swap partition.</p>

<p>The traditional (and safest) way is to back up everything on the drive, wipe it clean,
and start from scratch. First use DOS to create a FAT partition and restore Windows into
it, leaving space for Linux. Afterwards, use the Linux tools to install into the empty
space. If you can't be bothered to reformat and reload, <b>back it up anyway!</p>

<p></b>There are two ways to repartition a machine without reformatting. Supplied with
most Linux distributions is a tool called FIPS, which will shrink a FAT partition to
create empty space at the end of the disk into which you can install. Find FIPS on Linux
CD and study its documentation thoroughly. I've tried it, and it worked well, but
personally, I prefer the other method: third-party partitioners.</p>

<p>I know of three: PowerQuest PartitionMagic, Symantec PartitionIt, and V Communications'
Partition Commander. If you are buying one for this purpose, get PartitionMagic 4, as it's
the only one which can manipulate Linux ext2fs partitions.</p>

<p>Using any of them, you'll be able to resize your FAT partition to leave space for
Linux. Although a simple system will fit into around 500MB, at least a gigabyte is
advisable. At this point, the PC way of doing things diverges from traditional Unix
wisdom. The approved technique is to create separate partitions for the root, /usr and
/opt filesystems. If it's your first time, though, a single big root filesystem is far
easier.</p>

<p>As well as these, you must also have a separate swap partition, which the kernel uses
for virtual memory. A rule of thumb is to allocate twice as much swap space as the machine
has physical RAM, or up to four times as much if it's short of memory. Note that some
versions of Linux have a maximum swap partition size of 128MB.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calculate how big your root filesystem and swap partition will be, and add them
  together.</p>
  <p>Under DOS, resize your primary FAT partition to leave this much free space.</p>
  <p>Under Linux, create a single extended partition occupying all of this free space.</p>
  <p>Create the root filesystem at the start of the extended partition. It will be
  automatically set to type 83, the code for Linux filesystems.</p>
  <p>Create the swap partition to fill the rest of the space, and change its type to 82
  (Linux swap.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Installation</b></p>

<p>Most modern Linux installation programs are friendly, easy and complete with online
help. One common niggle, though, is the absence of a &quot;back&quot; button to return and
change answers given earlier, so take it slowly and think your decisions through.</p>

<p>Most installers offer a choice of standard configurations, such as minimal, minimal
with X, compact, standard and complete systems. It's preferable to start small. Once you
have a graphical system installed, it's easy to add components, so it's not necessary to
get everything right first time. Keep it simple at first and add things you need later,
rather than swamping your filesystem with thousands of packages. Distributions often
include a great deal of free programs of dubious quality and usefulness.</p>

<p>Two things to include are X (sometimes incorrectly called &quot;X Windows&quot;, and a
vital part of Linux' GUI) and the C compiler (required to recompile the kernel). Choose
XFree86 (plus libraries) and GNU `C' and `make' utility, but no other development tools.</p>

<p>Aside from them, use your discretion. Most other optional components are best added
later. RedHat and derivatives use the GraphicaL INstallation Tool, <em>glint</em>, whereas
KDE-based distributions such as Caldera and SuSE use <em>Kpackage</em>. If all else fails,
the <em>rpm</em> command is available.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font FACE="Courier New">

<p></font>Networking</b></p>

<p>Include this during installation, as the installation program will perform some of the
configuration for you. The major categories of tools are: 

<ul>
  <li>TCP/IP - fundamental to all Linux networking. If your machine will be a client, this is
    the only protocol you need.</li>
  <li>NFS - for networking to other Unix computers.</li>
  <li>Basic internet tools - most of the standard Linux internet tools, such as <i>elm</i>, <i>pine
    </i>and <i>tin </i>are poor, and should be avoided. Essentials are:<ul type="square">
      <li>Lynx - the text-mode web browser.</li>
      <li>An ftp client.</li>
      <li>Netscape, if it's available.</li>
      <li>Pppd and kppp (if using KDE) - the basic dial-up networking tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Samba - for networking to Windows. Note that some distributions, such as Caldera, treat
    the Samba mount and unmount utilities as optional extras.</li>
  <li>Netatalk - this is Appletalk, the Macintosh network protocol. Unnecessary except for
    servers.</li>
  <li>IPX, Netware client and Netware server - these Novell tools are unnecessary except for
    servers, unless you wish to connect to a Novell network.</li>
</ul>

<p>To network a Linux workstation to Windows or other Unix machines, you must use TCP/IP.
The simplest way is to add TCP/IP to all workstations, and give each one a unique IP
address in the form 10.0.0.<i>n</i>. The default network mask will probably be
255.0.0.0,and as long as it's the same on all machines, you can leave it. To look at
shared drives on Windows machines, use <i>smbclient</i>; to link to them, use the <i>smbmount</i>
command. Linux-to-Linux networking uses NFS, which is too complex to go into here.</p>

<p><b>Booting</b></p>

<p>This is often the most problematic area after partitioning. Let's start with a look at
the PC boot process.</p>

<p>All versions of DOS and Windows can only boot from a primary partition on the first
hard disk. The normal setup is a single primary partition, set as active, and the BIOS
boots the computer from that.</p>

<p>Other systems, such as Linux and OS/2 have no such restriction, and can load from any
partition on any drive that is accessible to the BIOS - which simply means that the
bootable filesystem must lie within the first 1,024 cylinders of the disk. Note, though,
that parallel-port devices are not accessible to most BIOSes, so you can't boot from such
a disk, nor from a SCSI disk on a &quot;dumb&quot; controller (one with no BIOS).</p>

<p>To allow the user to choose what OS to boot, something has to be loaded before the BIOS
gets as far as the active partition. There's one area that's scanned before this - the
very first part of the first hard disk, the <i>Master Boot Record.</i> So, a tiny program
has to be inserted into the MBR to offer a choice.</p>

<p>You can use the Linux loader, Lilo, or a more sophisticated third-party alternative.
The most capable is V Communications' System Commander; a simpler version is included with
the same company's Partition Commander, and an basic but pretty equivalent, BootMagic,
comes with PartitionMagic 4. PartitionMagic 3 includes a licensed copy of IBM's Boot
Manager, which is very capable but requires a special partition. Full documentation on
these comes with the respective programs.</p>

<p>The choice comes down to putting Lilo in the MBR, and using it to choose between DOS or
Linux, or using a third-party alternative and putting Lilo in the boot sector of the Linux
root filesystem.</p>

<p>When Lilo is booted, it looks for a file called <i>lilo.conf</i> in the /etc directory
of the root filesystem. (As it can't read the filesystem itself, it stores the location on
the disk of the file - so if you move or resize the root filesystem, you <i>must </i>re-run
Lilo so it can store the new position of lilo.conf.) This file contains a list of systems
that Lilo can boot; typically, the location of your Linux kernel, and a pointer to the
active primary partition so that you can still boot DOS. Lilo then presents a &quot;lilo:
&quot; prompt, and expects you to type the name of one of the entries. To see a list of
valid options, press the tab key, or just press Return to load Linux. If nothing is
entered, after a few seconds it loads the default entry.</p>
<b>

<p>Logging-in</b></p>

<p>Once your system is installed and booting, you will meet the first major difference
between Linux and DOS or Windows. Before you can do anything at all, you must log in.
Initially, you should log in under the root account, with whatever password you specified
during setup. To get your system running and all your applications installed, you will
have to use the root account - it is, by default, the only one allowed to mount and
unmount disks, for example. However, conventional Unix practise is that you shouldn't then
use the root account for anything else - you should create a user account and use that
instead. The reasoning is that it is very easy to damage your systems inadvertently by one
mistyped command when you're root. If you need to perform a couple of root operations, the
command <i>su</i> will let you briefly become the &quot;superuser&quot; and do them, then
exit back to your normal account.</p>

<p>Most Linux systems boot in text mode, and after you log in, you type <i>startx</i> or <i>kde</i>
to launch the GUI. It's possible to have Xstart at boot-up and log-in through it, but
that's beyond the scope of this piece.</p>

<p><b>Shutting down</b></p>

<p>When you are finished using the system, it's important to shut it down properly, or you
risk losing data. The official way is to <i>su</i> to root and type &quot;shutdown
now&quot;, but I find it easier to quit from X, logout with Ctrl-d and then press
Ctrl-Alt-Del, which resets Linux as it does DOS.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="sec6">Putting it to work</a></b></h2>

<p>Once everything's running, the next question is what to do with it - and, sadly, at
this point many people run out of ideas and give up. Instead, ask yourself what you
usually do with your PC.</p>

<p>For most of us, a good place to start is getting it onto the Internet, which means a
modem connection. Firstly, you need to know what serial port to use. If you configured
this during installation, you might have a /dev/modem device which points to the current
serial port. Otherwise, you must find it. Serial ports may be names /dev/cuan or
/dev/ttySn, where n is the number of the port, like DOS' COMn. Internal modems are often
port 3 or 4, and if yours is a Plug &amp; Play device, you may need to configure it with
the isapnp command.</p>

<p>The &quot;official&quot;, but tricky, way to configure a Net connection is using the
pppd daemon. This is one area where KDE really scores. Its kppp program just needs to be
told about your modem and ISP details, and you're away. If you don't know the port, trial
and error will do: you can pick ports from a drop-down list and click &quot;query
modem&quot; until it responds. Then, enter a name for your connection, and insert your
ISP's details: at a minimum, the telephone number. If this doesn't work, use Windows to
look on the ISP's website, or telephone its technical support line. The information you
need is: 

<ul>
  <li>Whether it uses static or dynamic IP addressing.</li>
  <li>If static, what your IP address is.</li>
  <li>The IP addresses of the primary and backup DNS servers.</li>
  <li>The IP address of their gateway.</li>
  <li>An example of a connection script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've obtained all this, select the ISP's entry in kppp and click Edit, then fill
in the respective tabs. On the Script tab, in turn, select &quot;expect&quot; or
&quot;send&quot; and click Insert for each line in the script. Note that there are two
special entries, ID and Password, which you can use instead of Send to transmit whatever
ID and password you enter on kppp's opening screen. When everything's filled-in, click
connect and try it!</p>

<p>Internet tools</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As mentioned in the Installation section, the Linux internet tool of choice is Netscape
  Communicator 4.7. It's free and vastly better than almost any of the alternatives. It's
  included with Caldera and some other distributions, but if you didn't get it, make it your
  first download. It's worth the wait, particularly as it will also enable you to read your
  online documentation, and with tools such as the excellent Webmin (www.webmin.com) can
  also be used to administer your machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Office productivity</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two main contenders here, <a href="http://www.corel.com">WordPerfect</a> and <a
  href="http://www.openoffice.org">StarOffice</a>. WordPerfect is a powerful and capable
  word-processor and a time-limited evaluation version is available for free download [<a
  href="images/wp8.jpg">screenshot</a>]. The rest of the WordPerfect suite hasn't been
  ported yet, although older versions of CorelDRAW! are available commercially. Older
  versions of StarOffice are bundled with some distributions and the latest v5 is available
  for free on Linux for non-commercial use. StarOffice includes all the usual office suite
  components, and has a similar look and feel to MS Office 97, whose files it can also
  handle; this article was entirely produced in it, for instance [<a
  href="images/staroff5.jpg">screenshot</a>]. It even includes a Start menu, Explorer and
  email client.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Graphics</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As well as the aforementioned CorelDRAW!, the premier image-manipulation application
  for Linux is the GNU Image Manipulation Program - the GIMP. Its user interface is minimal,
  but it is remarkably powerful - it was woefully underused producing the screenshots for
  this article. There are also various simpler viewers and converters, such as ImageMagick.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Games</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linux isn't really a games platform, although basics such as Solitaire and Mah Jongg do
  exist, along with unofficial ports of Doom and Quake. There are others; the best option is
  to search some of the popular software sites.</p>
  <p>There is also a wealth of commercial Unix software developed for commercial Unix
  variants such as SCO. Many of these can be coaxed into life on Linux via iBCS2. This is a
  Linux service which makes Linux conform to the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v2, a
  software platform to which many commercial products adhere. Such software ranges from
  high-end publishing packages such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> FrameMaker
  to scientific modelling tools such as <a href="http://www.wolframscientific.com">Mathematica</a>.
  Although you shouldn't expect free demonstration versions, you do get support and
  assistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p>Emulators</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can't find a Linux version of what you need, you may be able to run a version
  from another operating system. Most distributions include the &quot;BIOS Emulator&quot; <i>dosemu</i>.
  Dosemu is not a DOS emulator; it's a set of kernel services that allow a real copy of DOS
  to be booted in an X window [<a href="images/dosemu.jpg">screenshot</a>]. Caldera
  OpenLinux includes a hard disk image pre-installed with DR-DOS 7.02 for use with it. Many
  DOS applications (such as the <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk">CIX</a> off-line reader
  Matrix) run happily this way. Similarly for Windows programs there is Wine. The name
  stands for <i>Wine Is Not an Emulator</i>; instead, it's a translation layer that allows
  both 16- and 32-bit Windows programs to run under Linux and X. More information and
  downloads are available from www.winehq.com.</p>
  <p>Beware, though, that both Dosemu and Wine are unfinished, and neither is perfect yet.
  While the demands of DOS are simple enough that many programs will run, Wine isn't stable
  enough for heavy use yet. If you need to run Windows 3 applications under Linux, Caldera's
  Wabi may help [<a href="images/wabi.jpg">screenshot</a>]. Developed by Sun, Wabi allows a
  real copy of Windows 3.1x to run under Linux, translating Windows graphics calls to X ones
  on the fly. It boasts an impressive list of certified applications, including both
  Microsoft's and Lotus' application suites, but isn't perfect - for instance, it's unable
  to run the CIX Ameol2 OLR. Wabi is no longer being actively developed, but if you wish,
  say, to use MS Access under Linux, it's the best option. It's sold by Caldera for around
  $50. There are also a host of emulators for other computer systems, such as Fusion, which
  runs MacOS, and the Amiga emulator UAE.</p>

<p>In part two, I'll be looking at more advanced use, such as recompiling the kernel,
adding support for &quot;unusual&quot; devices such as sound, and the 2.2.n kernel. Where
Linux is beign used in businesses, it's typically as a server, so that area will come
under scrutiny as well. </p>
