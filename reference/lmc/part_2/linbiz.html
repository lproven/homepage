<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Linux in Business</h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To get an idea of how people are using Linux in business, we asked some
members of the CIX&nbsp;online system how they were using Linux. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We&#146;re prototyping a project using Oracle on Red Hat 5.1,
running on a 64Mb AMD K6-2/266 with 3.5Gb of hard disk. Although we&#146;re probably
switching to Sun machines for the final product, we&#146;re still going to be using PCs
running Linux as our web servers. Installation was very straight-forward - I set the BIOS
to boot from the CD-ROM and rebooted - and although I had minor problems with mount points
and Xfree86, the instructions were clear enough. Putting the machine on the network
wasn&#146;t difficult using Samba, although the smb.conf file had to be edited manually to
let the rest of the network see it.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I work as a techie for a London web design crew. At the office we
use Linux as the server/net access platform. We'd be a bit stuck without IP masquerading.
At home (and I work most of the time from home) I use it as my main machine. Currently I'm
working on a system that will be served from AIX - I'm using Linux to host the Web
application server.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We use Slackware Linux 3.5 for various internal engineering and
development jobs, mostly as a source of documentation or an example of how things
&quot;should be done&quot;. There are a number of areas in which its flexibility really
shines through, such as the ease with which an arbitrary program may be attached to
activity on an incoming socket using the <i>inetd</i> daemon. Hardware includes a range of
machines from a Pentium-II down to a 4MB 386/20 - it&#146;s an indication of the maturity
of the operating system that it runs without obvious race conditions on such a wide range
of systems. We use Delphi under Win32 and a portable version of this would be extremely
welcome, even if it used the GNU C compiler for code generation.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We're currently using it on multiprocessor machines as an
Internet-facing Web server, using Martin Poole's Secure Linux (LSSD). It provides a
Geocites-style web presence and e-mail and DNS for the network. As this is to be sat on a
co-hosted link in TeleCity, the system must be secure, able to stay up, and serve a large
visitor base on a 24×7 basis. It&#146;s also being used as an in-house development
platform for some web-based work, for network monitoring using tools such as <i>tcpdump</i>
and <i>sniffit</i>, and for reviewing security of servers and machines we set up for
clients. We&#146;re currently evaluating a test system using Oracle 8 as a replacement for
a client's old SCO Unix system.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've got 2 Linux boxes on a 'test' network within the Business Sales Group. One,
which used to run Novell, is a fileserver, and the other runs Apache and MySQL, which we
use for keeping annual leave records for people within the group. The most useful
application is a quick statistics thing I wrote in Perl. We get a report from our IT
Department every month telling us who sold what. This is imported in to another MySQL
database and managers can drill down on statistics through a browser. It's been a big hit,
and we&#146;re now adding dial in access for the Sales &amp; Marketing Director, who is on
a different network.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We use a pair of machines running Slackware with firewalled
2.0.3x kernels: a 32MB P133 Internet gateway (with IP masquerading), mostly for web
browsing, and a 64MB P166 running <i>sendmail </i>and a message store for exchanging mail
with the Internet and cc:Mail. Until recently, we were running on 486/66s with 32MB or
less, but we upgraded to get better kernels and newer (and more secure) versions of
sendmail etc. Compared to other UNIXes, Linux is a dream to install and maintain. Usually
if there's a problem it's well-documented in a HOWTO, FAQ, or numerous web-sites and
newsgroups.&quot;</p>
