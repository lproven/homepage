<p><font face="Arial">Linux 2.2</font></p>
</i>

<p><font face="Arial">The latest stable Linux kernel at the time of writing is v2.2.6, although many
distributions still use 2.0.36. The list of changes is long - Open Resources magazine
has a good <a href="http://www.openresources.com/magazine/linux-kernel-22">explanation</a>.
Some of the highlights are:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Considerably improved performance on multiprocessor machines (with 2 to 16 CPUs), plus
  other performance tweaks such as improved caching and swapping routines</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Specific optimisations for non-Intel processors, such as the Cyrix 6x86 and AMD K5 and
  K6</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The EIDE driver supports UltraDMA and busmastering on most Pentium chipsets, and is
  removable for all-SCSI&nbsp;machines</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Integration into the kernel of the functions of the previously separate kernel-module
  and automount daemons</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial">However, the minimum memory footprint has risen from 4 to 6MB, and USB&nbsp;support
wasn't finished in time to be included. Nor was DVD support, but most drives should work
with the ordinary CD-ROM&nbsp;driver.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Some recent distributions (such as Red&nbsp;Hat 5.2 and SuSE 6.0) ship with the older
kernel but claim to be &quot;2.2 ready.&quot; In theory, this means that although they
shipped before it was finished, the various supporting programs are versions that should
function correctly with the new kernel. (There&#146;s a full list at
http://www.linuxhq.com/change22.html.) Still, upgrading to a 2.2.x kernel is a non-trivial
exercise, and the improvements won't be relevant to everyone, especially if a machine is
going to be performing a simple function such as a gateway.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Not only must many other components be updated, the boot and INIT structures have
changed too - see the homepage for your distribution. Once an installation has been
tweaked for 2.2, it often will no longer run 2.0.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial">As such, it&#146;s not recommended to go to 2.2.x unless you are an expert - wait for
the distributor to ship a version with the new kernel built-in. At the time of writing,
SuSE 6.1, Caldera 2.2 and Slackware 4.0 are in final testing, and should be shipping by
press time; a 2.2 version of Debian is already available for the intrepid.</font></p>
