<h1><font size=5>Sharp JX-330P</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;955 </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: 0800-262958</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: A pricey unit, but you get what you pay for - a high-quality 
device with good software.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Sharp's entry into this Labs is an interesting and imposing unit. The scanner 
has an unusual, landscape orientation - the front is one of the longer edges, 
and originals go in on their &quot;side&quot;, top to the left. This is initially confusing, 
but it's easy to adapt. The scanbed itself is foolscap (American &quot;legal&quot;) 
sized, rather than the more common A4, which is useful, as the lip around 
the edge of the glass table is quite deep; a thick original which is bigger than 
foolscap size won't lie flat.</p>
<p>Around the back, the length of the scanner is filled with two full-size 
Amphenol connectors, two D25 connectors for the optional sheetfeeder and 
transparency adaptors, and, unfortunately, an old-fashioned bank of DIP 
switches for setting SCSI ID, termination etc. The power switch on one side 
is the only user control. The supplied SCSI adaptor is a full Adaptec 1510 
&quot;Total CD&quot; kit, which is useful, as it could be used for other devices as well 
as the scanner. </p>
<p>The only software provided is a 16-bit TWAIN driver and a copy of 
Photoshop. The TWAIN driver works acceptably under 95, but with some 
glitches - the Cancel button in the dialog boxes doesn't work, and you must 
click the Close control; and with PaintShop Pro, we got occasional &quot;Not 
enough memory&quot; messages, although PhotoShop was able to scan the same 
selection without difficulty. The driver has a wide range of controls, but most 
functions are operated by buttons, which aren't labelled, and there are no 
tooltips or other prompts to tell you what they do - you have to click them 
and see. Two amusing touches were the Japlish README file and the 
initialisation sequence. While it's loading, the TWAIN driver displays a little 
yellow cat icon (like the desktop toy Neko) which looks for the scanner. </p>
<p>The bundled software is the limited edition of Abode PhotoShop 3.0. This is 
a 32-bit application, but it was designed for use with Windows NT or 
Windows 3.1 using Win32s (which is included) - it predates Windows 95, 
but seems to work acceptably. It lacks many of the extras of the full version, 
such as online manuals, tutorial, extra filters, textures, images and so forth, 
but even so remains the ultimate retouching package. Since the full, 
standalone version of PhotoShop is &#163;350, this is a valuable addition, 
although some OCR software would be gratifying; Sharp says this is up to 
the individual reseller.</p>
<p>The scanner's performance was good; although it's not very fast, it gave 
good scores in all the tests, although just beaten by the higher-end models 
from Hewlett-Packard and Umax - both of which are slightly cheaper. It's 
the most expensive scanner this month, but it's also one of the best.</p>
