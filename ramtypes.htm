<hr>
<p>When PC Pro looked at 166MHz Pentium-class machines last November 
(issue 25 p77), for the first time there were a significant number of machines 
with the new HX and VX versions of Intel&#146;s 430 PCIset - the &quot;Triton&quot; 
chipset. One of the claimed advantages of the VX chipset was its ability to 
accept a new type of memory, Synchronous or SD RAM. </p>
<p>Conventional RAM, both FP and EDO, requires each memory location to 
be read in turn. FP-DRAM typically has a burst rate of 5/3/3/3 (the number 
of processor cycles required for each bit to be read in a 4-bit &quot;burst&quot;). EDO 
RAM improves on ordinary DRAM by pipelining the operation: while one 
location is still being read, the next is being prepared. This improves 
subsequent accesses, giving a burst rate of 5/2/2/2.</p>
<p>SDRAM is quite different. It exploits the fact that most PC memory 
accesses are sequential - i.e., blocks of memory are read rather than 
individual bytes. It is designed to fetch all the bits in a burst as fast as 
possible: the system controller provides the location and size of the block of 
memory required, and the SDRAM chip supplies the bits as fast as the CPU 
can take them - that is, synchronously. However, the initial command phase, 
when the block is defined, take longer, giving a burst rate of 6/1/1/1.</p>
<p>For issue 25, we tested one VX machine with ordinary &quot;Fast Page mode&quot; 
DRAM, EDO DRAM and SDRAM, but found that there was no significant 
performance difference between EDO and SDRAM, although both were 
about 5% better than FP DRAM. Because the gains were insignificant, 
SDRAM has remained fairly rare in mainstream machines, and it has stayed 
more expensive, at around twice the price of EDO RAM.</p>
<p>Now, Intel has released another version of the Triton chipset, the 430TX, 
which is claimed to be especially suitable for the new MMX Pentium 
processors - and it also supports SDRAM. We re-tested the ASUStek TX 
motherboard with 32MB EDO and SDRAM DIMMs and an MMX P200, 
and its score went from 3.94 to 4.02 - an improvement of only 2%. It looks 
like SDRAM&#146;s time won&#146;t come until motherboard bus speeds improve to 
much more than the current 66MHz, thus reducing that initial command 
phase time.</p>
