<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;129 </font></h3>

<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Good hardware, let down by unhelpful software - even if sie

<hr>
<p>The MiroVIDEO 22SD is based around an S3 Trio64V+ accelerator, the 
new video-enhanced version of this popular single-chip graphics controller, 
which has hardware-assisted smoothing and interpolation of video 
data-streams. When it comes to on-card memory, the fastest type is 
VRAM, which is dual-ported so that both the graphics controller and the 
RAMDAC can access it at once. If they're both in the same chip, as is the 
case with the S3 Trio64V+, this is difficult or impossible, so such devices 
tend to use cheaper DRAM, in this case fast EDO DRAM. Video playback 
is quite reasonable, with good video quality, but both MPEG and AVI files 
suffer from dropped frames.</p>
<p>Miro's software has potential, but needs a lot more refinement. All the 
drivers are supplied on CD, and you have to know where to find them - 
there's no OEMSETUP.INF file in the root directory to help you. Once the 
drivers are installed, the PC reboots and you are taken straight into Miro's 
utility installation program - which is entirely in German. You can choose 
English operation, but it's not immediately apparent, and many people would 
panic when confronted with a screenful of a foreign language. In addition, 
the demonstration software supplied and its installer all default to German, 
too.</p>
<p>Along with the near-ubiquitous XING MPEG, there are tools for adjusting 
screen image position and size, as well as colour correction utilities. All these 
are controlled from a floating toolbar called the MiroPINBOARD, but we 
found this confusing and gimmicky; for instance, when changing resolution 
there's no period of grace during which you can back-out, so it's all too easy 
to choose a resolution that your monitor can't display. If this happens, you 
must restart the PC in Safe mode and choose a less demanding mode - 
losing any unsaved work in the process. Strangely, the Microsoft 
&quot;QuickRes&quot; program couldn't be used to change modes on this card, either.</p>
<p>Sadly, the card doesn't compensate for poor software by having good 
performance: it was in the bottom four of our speed table in both 256 and 
65,536 colour modes. Since all the other Trio64 cards did much better, it's 
likely that the inferior utilities accompany low-performance drivers. Miro 
must fix these, and soon; until they do, look elsewhere.</p>
