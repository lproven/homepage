<h1><font size=5>WYSEvision WY-17E</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Good value for money will outrank indifferent performance 
for those on a tight budget. </font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Price: &#163;474</font></h3>
<h3><font size=3>Supplier: Wyse 01734-342200</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>In the days of serial text terminals, the Wyse 60 was a best-seller, but the 
name isn't as well-known in these days of high-resolution colour displays - 
although they are sometimes seen under the name of Link, as supplied with 
the CompuSys PC in last month's Labs.</p>
<p>The CRT is a shadow-mask model, with a comparatively coarse 0.28mm 
dot pitch, but the display is sharper than most of the other .28dp screens; 
however, the focus is poor in the corners. Like some others, one area where 
it really falls down is screen regulation: the whole screen &quot;bounces&quot; when a 
large area changes between black and white. Objects will change size and 
shape slightly depending on whether they're drawn in black on white, or 
white on black, which may be important when doing intensive graphics or 
CAD work. There were also problems with ghosting and streaking when 
displaying large high-contrast blocks.</p>
<p>Physically, the unit is quite small and light - something for which Wyse are 
well-known. Aside from that, the unit resembles the NEC: the fascia is very 
wide, with the controls just beneath the screen, and the cables aren't 
recessed very far into the back. The on-screen menus are fairly clear and 
helpful, and when the menus are not displayed, the same buttons control 
brightness and contrast - a neat touch. Minus points, though, for the captive 
signal cable, although the absence of BNC connectors isn't surprising at this 
price level.</p>
<p>The monitor wasn't specifically recognised by Windows 95, appearing just 
as VESA DDC, with a maximum resolution of only 1024x768. Overriding 
this with a generic choice upped the maximum to 1280x1024, but this was 
at only 60Hz, making it unsuitable for prolonged use. The minimal manual 
isn't much help, either, with no troubleshooting section.</p>
<p>Overall, though, these criticisms fade when you look at the price: it's less 
than half the cost of the NEC, for instance, for which it's worth overlooking 
some of its failings.</p>
