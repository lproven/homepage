<p>Ergo Computer made their name from with the launch of their first machine, 
the innovative Brick; a genuinely new approach to portable computing, it 
was essentially a ruggedized miniature desktop PC - a black block 
containing all the usual PC components, but lacking screen, keyboard or 
batteries. The idea was that as many people never actually use their 
portables on the move, you just needed to have a standard screen, 
keyboard and mouse at each end of your journey, and carry a tough, 
lightweight CPU around. Although attractive, it was expensive and unusual, 
and Ergo now make more conventional notebooks. </p>
<p>The PowerBrick is a tidy power-user's multimedia portable: along with its 
Pentium processor and PCI motherboard, it has floppy and CD drives, 
integrated sound courtesy of the increasingly-common ESS688 AudioDrive 
chipset, and an infra-red port. The details of its construction are good: it has 
a headphone socket on its CD drive, two proper volume controls for this 
and the integral stereo speakers, catches to prevent accidental movement of 
CD tray and power switch, and an S-Video output which enables 
connection to a suitably-equipped TV or VCR. The keyboard is rattly but 
responsive, with good key travel, and the whole machine can be tilted up to 
a cofortable angle on two fold-out legs. Its trackpad is reasonably sensitive 
- but if you prefer, you can swap it for a trackball. Most of its internal 
devices are removable to allow for expansion or customisation; the floppy 
drive can be replaced with a second battery, and both hard and CD drives 
are removable, but Ergo don't have many options yet: although floppy and 
CD bays could take other devices, there aren't any. Nor are the docking 
station or port replicator. Confusingly, there's a US-style telephone jack by 
the sound connectors, but there's nothing connected to it unless the optional 
internal modem is fitted - both 14.4 and 28.8Kbit/s models are shipping, 
along with an MPEG-1 decoder card. Another choice is either an active or 
passive matrix screen - we had an active TFT display, but the passive 
DSTN saves &#163;400. One drawback is that the battery only charges when the 
machine is switched off; the forthcoming port-replicator will have an integral 
battery charger to alleviate this.The machine we looked at was an early 
model, with a Philips double-speed CD-ROM drive; the latest models have 
EIDE units instead.It also had a US-layout keyboard, which should also 
change.</p>
<p>This is a polished machine, and will become more attractive as more options 
become available - but unlike PC Cards, notebook &quot;modules&quot; aren't 
standardised, so the range will never be very big, and there won't be any 
more options after this model is superseded. One part that will be easy to 
replace is the battery, which is a standard Toshiba unit.</p>
<h2><font size=3>Verdict</font></h2>
<p>A neat and well-integrated multimedia portable, with a wide range of 
options. For this price, we'd prefer to see 16Mb of RAM instead of the 
TFT screen, which would make the machine faster and give longer battery 
life, but otherwise it's hard to fault.</p>
