<h3><font size=3>Verdict: Well-chosen and assembled hardware at a keen price</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>West One's debut in PC Pro Labs is impressive: its machine features several 
interesting new technologies, including a TR5 motherboard based around 
the Intel 430VX chipset supporting a Cyrix 6x86 P133+ processor. All this 
is in the same screwless case used by Red Box. Inside, the expansion port 
blanking plates are also clip-on items, although they're held in with screws as 
well.</p>
<p>The interior is very clean, and we were impressed to see a 
soundcard-to-CD cable clipped into the base, alongside one of the many 
printed identification labels that also identify the various clips and ports 
throughout the system. The drive cables were folded and tied back, 
revealing 4 empty SIMM sockets, above which is a socket containing a 
64-bit SDRAM Dual Inline Memory Module. DIMMs are the new format 
for adding memory to 64-bit PCs and Macintoshes, their advantage being 
that they can be used singly, unlike 32-bit SIMMs. Synchronous DRAM is 
a new type of memory chip, faster than EDO, but at present it's only 
supported by the Triton VX chipset, and both VX and SDRAM are still 
quite rare. </p>
<p>Other components are good, too. There's a Quantum Fireball 1280A HD, 
filled from a Mitsumi 6X CD-ROM. Sadly, though, West One hasn't loaded 
the bus-mastering drivers for the PIIX3 EIDE controller used in both Triton 
VX and HX. Windows 95 version 950a was pre-installed (and configured 
for USA operation), but no other software apart from the graphics driver for 
the Stealth 2000 3D card. This is based on the new S3 ViRGE chip, which 
is essentially a Trio64V+ with on-chip 3D rendering hardware. The Trio64 
is a good, fast graphics controller, but the 3D functionality won't be any use 
to most people. By and large, only games use intensive 3D graphics on PCs 
today, and as there's no standard 3D API for DOS games, most 3D games 
won't benefit from the ViRGE unless they are specially written for it. In time, 
this might change, as Microsoft will be adding standardised 3D APIs to 
Windows 95: OpenGL for business use and Direct3D for games. The 
Stealth drives a rather basic 15in monitor, which was disappointingly fuzzy. 
The keyboard is an excellent Fujitsu, as favoured by Panrix, but the mouse 
is a horrid QuickShot, as used by MJN, Colossus et al.</p>
<p>The machine's performance is good, but the P133+Cyrix lacks the edge of 
the P166+, because the P133+ runs at a lower bus speed than its Intel 
equivalent - 55MHz as opposed to 66. Overall, the system is excellent value 
for money, but West One should put the same care into the software setup 
as it does into the hardware.</p>
