<h1><font size="5">Panrix Micron P166</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font size="3">Supplier: Panrix 01132-444958</font></h3>
<h3><font size="3">Price: &#163;2,390</font></h3>
<h3><font size="3">Verdict: a well-put-together machine, but
nothing outstanding, and Panrix commit the same small sins as
others.</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Panrix is a familiar name in PC Pro, having won quite a few
awards from us in the past for well-built high-performance
machines. Today, though, the company&#146;s strategy is changing:
than independently choosing all the parts and assembling its own
machines, it&#146;s entered a partnership with respected US
manufacturer Micron. Essentially, Panrix are assembling the same
machines as Micron sells in America, and selling them here under
their own name as the Micron range.</p>
<p>The case is the same as ever, and still says Panrix on the
front. It&#146;s a good design - this variant is the mini-tower,
and it&#146;s also used by Armari and Polar this month. The lid
is removed easily after undoing a single thumbscrew at the rear,
but after that, the case removes easily. With three drives
fitted, there are still three free bays, which is quite
reasonable. What is neat is the rear hard disk cage, which is
mounted over the PSU. It&#146;s on a hinge, which makes fitting
or inspecting hard disks easy. All the drive bays are at the top
of the tower, leaving the motherboard largely unobscured. The CPU
is at the bottom, fouling any long PCI cards, but we haven&#146;t
seen any of these, so it&#146;s not critical. There are only six
slots in total, which is a bit stingy, but none are shared, which
is a plus. There&#146;s a dummy slot right at the bottom, where a
small daughter board connects to supply sound connectors to the
rear panel. These connect to the onboard Vibra16 sound chip,
which offers reasonable 16-bit SoundBlaster-compatible sound.
Sample playback is reasonable, but there&#146;s a noticeable hiss
in the background. However, playback of audio CDs sounds
excellent through the brilliant Yamaha speakers.</p>
<p>Other components are good, if unsurprising, choices: a 1.2Gb
Quantum Fireball and a Teac six-speed CD-ROM drive. A Supra V.34
modem is a pleasing extra, sensibly configured to interrupt 11 to
avoid conflicts with the MS Mouse on COM1. The display is handled
by a Matrox MGA Millennium with a 220MHz DAC, outputting to a
bright and crisp Idek Iiyama VisionMaster 17 - a good screen,
albeit with fiddly on-screen menus: everything, even brightness
and contrast, is controlled by just three buttons.</p>
<p>As far as the Panrix&#146;s software set-up goes, it&#146;s
like the curate&#146;s egg: good in parts. It&#146;s commendable
to see that Panrix has installed DOS drivers for the sound card
and CD-ROM, but the monitor was left set as &quot;Unknown&quot;,
and none of the extras such as CompCore&#146;s software MPEG
decoder were installed. Other minor glitches were the spurious
PS/2 mouse port detected by Windows 95 - once a common problem,
but getting less common now with newer BIOSs. Panrix offer two
good value Microsoft application bundles: either Office
Professional (with Access 95) for the business user, or a 14-CD
bundle of SoHo/Leisure packages, including Works, Money, Encarta
and many others.</p>
<p>Overall, though, this machine is a little disappointing.
Though nothing&#146;s obviously wrong, the performance is some
way behind the leading machines&#146; and the software setup
isn&#146;t as thorough as it could, and should, be.</p>
